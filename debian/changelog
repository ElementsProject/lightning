  * Added (config): New option `--important-plugin` loads a plugin is so important that if it dies, `lightningd` will exit rather than continue.  You can still `--disable-plugin` it, however, which trumps `--important-plugin` and it will not be started at all.
  * Added (Plugins): We now explicitly check at startup that our default Bitcoin backend (bitcoind) does relay transactions.
  * Added (Plugins): We now explicitly check at startup the version of our default Bitcoin backend (bitcoind).

  * Changed (gossipd): The `gossipd` is now a lot quieter, and will log only when a message changed our network topology.
  * Changed (Protocol): We now make MPP-aware routehints in invoices.
  * Changed (onchaind): We now scorch the earth on theft attempts, RBFing up our penalty transaction as blocks arrive without a penalty transaction getting confirmed.

  * Changed (JSON-RPC): `withdraw` now randomizes input and output order, not BIP69.
  * Changed (JSON-RPC): `txprepare` reservations stay across restarts: use `fundpsbt`/`reservepsbt`/`unreservepsbt`
  * Changed (config): `min-capacity-sat` is now stricter about checking usable capacity of channels.
  * Changed (Protocol): Ignore (and log as "unusual") repeated `WIRE_CHANNEL_REESTABLISH` messages, to be compatible with buggy peer software that sometimes does this.

  * Changed (config): the default CLTV expiry is now 34 blocks, and final expiry 18 blocks as per new BOLT recommendations.
  * Changed (Plugins): Builtin plugins are now marked as important, and if they crash, will cause C-lightning to stop as well.
  * Changed (Protocol): Funding timeout is now based on the header count reported by the bitcoin backend instead of our current blockheight which might be lower.

  * Fixed (Plugins): `pay` is less aggressive with forgetting routehints.
  * Fixed (Plugins): `pay` no longer ignores routehints if the payment exceeds 10,000 satoshi. This is particularly bad if the payee is only reachable via routehints in an invoice.
  * Fixed (Plugins): `pay` limits the number of splits if the payee seems to have a low number of channels that can enter it, given the max-concurrent-htlcs limit.
  * Fixed (Plugins): `pay` will now make reliable multi-part payments to nodes it doesn't have a node_announcement for.
  * Fixed (JSON-RPC): significant speedups for plugins which create large JSON replies (e.g. listpays on large nodes).
  * Fixed (doc): Many missing manual pages were completed
  * Fixed (Build): Fixed compile error on macos
  * Fixed (pyln): Fixed HTLCs hanging indefinitely if the hook function raises an exception. A safe fallback result is now returned instead.
  * Fixed (Protocol): We now hang up if peer doesn't respond to init message after 60 seconds.
  * Fixed (elementsd): PSBTs include correct witness_utxo struct for elements transactions
  * Fixed (cli): fixed crash with `listconfigs` in `-H` mode
  * Fixed (Plugins): `bcli` significant speedups for block synchronization
  * Fixed (Build): On systems with multiple installed versions of the PostgreSQL client library, C-Lightning might link against the wrong version or fail to find the library entirely. `./configure` now uses `pg_config` to locate the library.
  * Fixed (Build): On some operating systems the postgresql library would not get picked up. `./configure` now uses `pg_config` to locate the headers.
  * Fixed (libplugin): significant speedups for reading large JSON replies (e.g. calling listsendpays on large nodes, or listchannels / listnodes).

  * Protocol: we don't send redundant node_announcement on every new channel.
  * Config: config file can override lightning-dir (makes sense with --conf).
  * Config: --conf option is now relative to current directory, not lightning-dir.
  * lightning-cli: help <cmd> prints basic information even if no man page found.
  * JSON API: getinfo now reports global statistics about forwarded payments, including total fees earned and amounts routed.
  * JSON RPC: listchannels' flags field. This has been split into two fields, see Added.
  * JSON RPC: global_features and local_features fields: use globalfeatures and localfeatures as per BOLT #1.
  * Startup: more coherent complaint if daemon already running.
  * Lightningd: correctly save full HTLCs across restarts; fixup old databases.
  * JSON RPC: getinfo now shows correct Tor port.
  * JSON RPC: ping now works even after one peer fails to respond.
  * JSON RPC: getroute fuzzpercent and pay maxfeepercent can now be > 100.
  * JSON RPC: riskfactor in pay and getroute no longer always treated as 1.
  * JSON-RPC: listpeers was always reporting 0 for all stats.
  * JSON RPC: withdraw all says Cannot afford transaction if you have absolutely no funds, rather than Output 0 satoshis would be dust.
  * Protocol: don't send gossip about closed channels.
  * Protocol: fix occasional deadlock when both peers flood with gossip.
  * Protocol: fix occasional long delay on sending reply_short_channel_ids_end.
  * Protocol: re-send node_announcement when address/alias/color etc change.
  * Protocol: multiple HTLCs with the same payment_hash are handled correctly.
  * Options: 'autotor' defaults to port 9051 if not specified.

lightningd (0.6.1-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Protocol: gossipd now deliberately delays spamming with channel_update.
  * Protocol: liveness ping when we commit changes but peer is idle: speeds up failures and reduces forced closures.
  * Protocol: option_data_loss_protect now supported to protect peers against being out-of-date.
  * JSON API: Added description to invoices and payments (#1740).
  * JSON API: getinfo has new fields alias and color.
  * JSON API: listpeers has new fields global_features and local_features.
  * JSON API: listnodes has new field global_features.
  * JSON API: ping command to send a ping to a connected peer.
  * JSON API: feerates command to retrieve current fee estimates.
  * JSON API: withdraw and fundchannel can be given manual feerate.
  * Config: --conf option to set config file.
  * Documentation: Added CHANGELOG.md
  * pylightning: RpcError now has method and payload fields.
  * Sending lightningd a SIGHUP will make it reopen its log-file, if any.
  * Protocol: Fee estimates are now smoothed over time, to avoid sudden jumps.
  * Config: You can only announce one address if each type (IPv4, IPv6, TORv2, TORv3).
  * lightning-cli: the help command for a specific command now runs the man command.
  * HSM: The HSM daemon now maintains the per-peer secrets, rather than handing them out. It's still lax in what it signs though.
  * connectd: A new daemon lightning_connectd handles connecting to/from peers, instead of gossipd doing that itself. lightning_openingd now handles peers immediately, even if they never actually open a channel.
  * Test: python-xdist is now a dependency for tests.
  * Logging: JSON connections no longer spam debug logs.
  * Routing: We no longer consider channels that are not usable either because of their capacity or their htlc_minimum_msat parameter (#1777)
  * We now try to connect to all known addresses for a peer, not just the one given or the first one announced.
  * Crash logs are now placed one-per file like crash.log.20180822233752
  * We will no longer allow withdrawing funds or funding channels if we do not have a fee estimate (eg. bitcoind not synced); use new feerate arg.
  * JSON API: listpeers results no long have alias and color fields; they're in listnodes (we used to internally merge the information).
  * JSON API: listpeers will never have state field (it accidentally used to exist and set to GOSSIPING before we opened a channel). connected will indicate if we're connected, and the channels array indicates individual channel states (if any).
  * Config: default-fee-rate is no longer available; use explicit feerate option if necessary.
  * Removed all Deprecated options from 0.6.
  * Protocol: node_announcement multiple addresses are correctly ordered and uniquified.
  * Protocol: if we can't estimate feerate, be almost infinitely tolerant of other side setting fees to avoid unilateral close.
  * JSON API: listnodes: now displays node aliases and colors even if they don't advertise a network address
  * JSON API: fundchannel all: now restricts to 2^24-1 satoshis rather than failing.
  * JSON API: listnodes: now correctly prints addresses if more than one is advertised.
  * Config: bind-addr of a publicly accessible network address was announced.
  * When we reconnect and have to retransmit failing HTLCs, the errors weren't encrypted by us.
  * lightningd_config man page is now installed by make install.
  * Fixed crash when shutting down during opening a channel (#1737)
  * Don't lose track of our own output when applying penalty transaction (#1738)
  * Protocol: channel_update inside error messages now refers to correct channel.
  * Stripping type prefix from channel_updates that are nested in an onion reply to be compatible with eclair and lnd (#1730).
  * Failing tests no longer delete the test directory, to allow easier debugging (Issue: #1599)

lightningd (0.6-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * While there are far too many new features in the 0.6 release to list, the following are the most interesting and impactful: Lightweight nodes: Previous releases required a full bitcoind node running alongside c-lightning, to provide access to the Bitcoin network. Thisrelease still requires the bitcoin-cli utility to be present, but it can now talk to remote nodes as well, including some lightweight nodes such as spruned. This makes it possible to run a c-lightning node on Raspberry Pis as well as other low-powered devices.
  * The gossip protocol has been updated to use a more lightweight bandwidth mechanism that asks for specific information, rather than exchanging full network views as the previous release did. This is particularly important for low-powered and mobile devices that would otherwise spend a lot of bandwidth and energy downloading and verifying information they already have.
  * API stability: The c-lightning JSON-RPC interface and supporting libraries have been redesigned in order to minimize changes in future releases. This API stability should make it easy for other projects to build on top of c-lightning because we will support this version of the API for the foreseeable future, maintaining backward compatibility, should we introduce any changes.
  * Wallet and sync: c-lightning now includes a full-fledged wallet that manages both on-chain and off-chain funds. There is no more raw transaction handling! All funds are automatically tracked and returned to the internalwallet as soon as possible, with no user interaction required. In addition the blockchain tracking now maintains an internal view of the blockchain,ending long blockchain rescans.
  * TOR support: c-lightning now supports connecting to nodes over the TOR network, auto-registering as a hidden service, and accepting incoming connections over TOR.
  * The payment logic has undergone a major overhaul to support automatic retries for routing failures, randomization of route selection, and better feedback about the current state of a payment.
  * And as always: performance, performance, performance.
