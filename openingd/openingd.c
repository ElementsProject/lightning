/*~ Welcome to the opening daemon: gateway to channels!

 * This daemon handles a single peer.  It's happy to trade gossip with the
 * peer until either lightningd asks it to fund a channel, or the peer itself
 * asks to fund a channel.  Then it goes through with the channel opening
 * negotiations.  It's important to note that until this negotiation is complete,
 * there's nothing permanent about the channel: lightningd will only have to
 * commit to the database once openingd succeeds.
