.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm lowdown
.Op input_options
.Op output_options
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl M Ar metadata
.Op Fl m Ar metadata
.Op Fl o Ar file
.Op Fl t Ar mode
.Op Fl X Ar keyword
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Translate from
.Xr lowdown 5
into diverse output formats.
Results are written to standard output.
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl s
Standalone mode.
This emits a document envelope surrounding the output by drawing from
document metadata.
See
.Sx Metadata
on providing information to the document envelope.
This applies to
.Fl t Ns Ar gemini ,
.Fl t Ns Ar html ,
.Fl t Ns Ar latex ,
.Fl t Ns Ar ms ,
.Fl t Ns Ar man ,
and
.Fl t Ns Ar fodt .
.It Fl M Ar metadata
Provide a single metadata key-value pair.
This may be in the usual
.Xr lowdown 5
colon-separated metadata format or instead separated by an equal sign,
depending upon which character comes first.
Exits with an error if given neither colon nor equal sign.
May be invoked multiple times for each pair.
This overrides
.Fl m
and what's parsed from the document.
.It Fl m Ar metadata
Like
.Fl M ,
but is overridden by what's parsed the document, then
.Fl M .
.It Fl o Ar file
Send output to
.Ar file
unless it's
.Dq - ,
in which case fall back to the default of standard output.
.It Fl t Ar mode , Fl T Ar mode
The output mode.
This may be
.Ar html
for HTML5 output,
.Ar latex
for LaTeX,
.Ar gemini
for the Gemini format,
.Ar ms
for roff output using the classic (i.e., no-extension)
.Fl ms
package and needing table support,
.Ar term
for ANSI-compatible UTF-8 terminal output,
.Ar man
for roff output using the classic
.Fl man
package,
.Ar tree ,
to show the parse tree of the input document, and
.Ar null
to parse the document but do no rendering.
See
.Sx Output modes .
The
.Fl T Ar mode
form is retained for backward compatibility.
.It Fl X Ar keyword
Output the metadata value of
.Ar keyword
or an empty string if not found.
The
.Fl t
mode is ignored.
.It Ar file
Input Markdown document.
If not given or if
.Ar file
is
.Dq - ,
it is read from standard input.
.El
.Pp
The following are options for input parsing.
These affect the parse tree passed to all outputs.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -parse-hilite
Enable highlight span support.
This are disabled by default because it may be erroneously interpreted
as section headers.
.It Fl -parse-math
Recognise mathematics equations.
.It Fl -parse-maxdepth=depth
The maximum depth of nested elements.
This defaults to 128, which is probably more than enough for any
real-world document.
If the maximum is hit, the system exits as if memory were exhausted.
Set to zero for no maximum.
.It Fl -parse-no-autolink
Do not parse
.Li http ,
.Li https ,
.Li ftp ,
.Li mailto ,
and relative links or link fragments.
.It Fl -parse-no-cmark
Do not parse with CommonMark constraints.
This also disables using the first ordered list value instead of
starting all lists at one.
.It Fl -parse-no-codeindent
Do not parse indented content as code blocks.
.It Fl -parse-no-deflists
Do not parse PHP extra definition lists.
.It Fl -parse-no-ext-attrs

Deprecated.
See
.Fl -parse-no-ext-attrs .
.It Fl -parse-no-intraemph
Do not parse emphasis within words and links.
.It Fl -parse-no-metadata
Do not parse MMD metadata.
For the first paragraph to count as metadata, the first line must have
a colon in it.
This does not affect metadata given on
.Fl m
or
.Fl M .
.It Fl -parse-no-strike
Do not parse strikethroughs.
.It Fl -parse-no-super
Do not parse super-scripts.
.It Fl -parse-no-tables
Do not parse GFM tables.
.It Fl -parse-no-tasklists

The following are shared by all output modes:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -out-standalone
Alias for
.Fl s .
.It Fl -out-no-smarty
Do not use the smart typography filter.
By default, certain character sequences are translated into
output-specific glyphs.
.El
.Pp
What follows are per-output options.
For HTML with
.Fl t Ns Ar html ,
these are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -html-hardwrap
Hard-wrap paragraph content by outputting line breaks where applicable.
.It Fl -html-no-escapehtml
If
.Fl -html-no-skiphtml
has been specified, this causes embedded HTML not to be escaped, and is
instead output verbatim.

Do not output
.Li id

Don't normalise HTML entities (when possible) as numeric ones and
instead use the entities as given on input.

Don't follow the OWASP recommendations for escaping text, and do only
the minimal escaping to make sure that regular content isn't interpreted
as HTML.
.It Fl -html-no-skiphtml
Output embedded HTML.
By default, embedded HTML is not output at all.
See
.Fl -html-no-escapehtml .
.El
.Pp
For both
.Fl t Ns Ar man

.Fl t Ns Ar ms ,
the following apply:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -nroff-no-groff
Don't use
.Xr groff 1
style section headings, PDF hyperlinks and multi-page tables (these further
require
.Fl t Ns Ar ms
mode and
.Fl m Ns Ar spdf
passed to
.Xr groff 1 ) ,
or Unicode sequence syntax.
The output is compatible with traditional
.Xr troff 1 .
Applies to
.Fl t Ns Ar man

.Fl t Ns Ar ms .
.It Fl -nroff-no-numbered
Don't output numbered headings.
Only applies to
.Fl t Ns Ar ms .

.It Fl -term-hmargin=margin
The number of left margin spaces.
Truncated to the number of columns.
Defaults to zero.
.It Fl -term-no-ansi

not emit any colour codes.
.It Fl -term-nolinks
Don't show URLs for images and links (autolinks are still shown).
.Pq Link content is still shown.
Overrides
.Fl -term-shortlinks
for images and links.
.It Fl -term-shortlinks

.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -gemini-link-end
Emit the queue of links at the end of the document instead of after the
nearest block element.

It should not be used unless in carefully crafted documents.
.It Fl -gemini-link-noref
Do not format link labels.
Takes precedence over
.Fl -gemini-link-roman .
.It Fl -gemini-link-roman
When formatting link labels, use lower-case Roman numerals instead of the
default lower-case hexavigesimal (i.e.,
.Dq a ,
.Dq b ,
\&...,
.Dq aa ,
.Dq ab ,
\&...).
.It Fl -gemini-metadata
Print metadata as the canonicalised key followed by a colon then the
value, each on one line (newlines replaced by spaces).
The metadata block is terminated by a double newline.

.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -latex-no-numbered

.El
.Pp
The
.Fl t Ns Ar fodt

.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -odt-no-skiphtml

.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Pp
If the

flag is used,
.Nm lowdown
exits with an error if the given keyword is not found.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To view a Markdown file on an ANSI-compatible, UTF-8 terminal:
.Pp
.Dl lowdown -tterm foo.md | less -R
.Pp
The terminal may also be used with
.Xr groff 1
or
.Xr mandoc 1
rendering:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lowdown -stms foo.md | groff -itk -mspdf -Tutf8 | less -R
lowdown -stman foo.md | groff -itk -man -Tutf8 | less -R
lowdown -stman foo.md | mandoc | less
.Ed
.Pp
To emit a standalone HTML5 document:
.Pp
.Dl lowdown -s foo.md > foo.html
.Pp
To use
.Xr groff 1
or
.Xr mandoc 1
to format as a PS file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lowdown -stms foo.md | groff -itk -mspdf > foo.ps
lowdown -stman foo.md | mandoc -Tps > foo.ps
.Ed
.Pp
Or with LaTeX:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lowdown -stlatex foo.md > foo.latex
pslatex foo.latex
.Ed
.Pp
PDF generation follows similar logic:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lowdown -stms foo.md | pdfroff -itk -mspdf > foo.pdf
lowdown -stman foo.md | mandoc -Tpdf > foo.pdf
lowdown -stlatex foo.md > foo.latex
pdflatex foo.latex
.Ed
.Pp
UTF-8 support for
.Xr groff 1
PDF or PS output requires appropriate fonts, such as the Unicode Times
font.
This and other Unicode fonts are not always installed by default.
They may be found, for PDF output, in the
.Pa devpdf
set of the
.Xr groff 1
font directory and are prefixed with
.Sq U .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lowdown -stms foo.md | pdfroff -itk -mspdf -FU-T > foo.pdf
