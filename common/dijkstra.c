	 * and calculate their tentative distances through the current
	 * node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the
	 * current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if
	 * the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge
	 * connecting it with a neighbour B has length 2, then the distance to
	 * B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a
	 * distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, the current
	 * value will be kept.
	 *
	 * 4. When we are done considering all of the unvisited neighbouds of
	 * the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it
	 * from the unvisited set. A visited node will never be checked again.
	 *
	 * 5. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a
	 * route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative
	 * distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when
	 * planning a complete travedsal; occuds when there is no connection
	 * between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then
	 * stop. The algorithm has finished.
	 *
	 * 6.  Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the
	 * smallest tentative distance, set it as the new "current node", and
	 * go back to step 3.
