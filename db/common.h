 * Macro to annotate a named SQL query.

 * different SQL dialects. It is used both as a marker for the query
 * extraction logic in devtools/sql-rewrite.py to identify queries, as well as
 * a way to swap out the query text with it's name so that the query execution
 * engine can then look up the rewritten query using its name.
