lightning-signpsbt -- Command to sign a wallet's inputs on a provided bitcoin transaction (PSBT).
=================================================================================================

SYNOPSIS
--------

**signpsbt** *psbt* [*signonly*]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

**signpsbt** is a low-level RPC command which signs a PSBT as defined by
BIP-174.

- *psbt*: A string that represents the PSBT value.
- *signonly*: An optional array of input numbers to sign.

By default, all known inputs are signed, and others ignored: with
*signonly*, only those inputs are signed, and an error is returned if
one of them cannot be signed.

Note that the command will fail if there are no inputs to sign, or
if the inputs to be signed were not previously reserved.

--------------------
```json
{
  "id": 82,
  "method": "signpsbt",
  "params": {
    "psbt": "some_psbt"

------------

[comment]: # (GENERATE-FROM-SCHEMA-START)
On success, an object is returned, containing:
