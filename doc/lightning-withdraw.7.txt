NAME
----
lightning-withdraw - Command for withdrawing funds from the 
internal wallet.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*withdraw* 'destination' 'satoshi'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *withdraw* RPC command sends funds from c-lightning's 
internal wallet to the address specified in 'destination'.

The address can be of any Bitcoin accepted type, 
including bech32.

'satoshi' is the amount to be withdrawn from the internal 
wallet (expressed, as name suggests, in satoshi). 
The string 'all' can be used to specify withdrawal of all 
available funds.


RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, an object with attributes 'tx' and 'txid' will 
be returned. 

'tx' represents the raw bitcoin, fully signed, transaction
and 'txid' represent the bitcoin transaction id.

On failure, an error is reported and the withdrawal transaction is not created.

The following error codes may occur:

* -1. Catchall nonspecific error.
* 301. There are not enough funds in the internal wallet (including fees) to
       create the transaction.
* 302. The dust limit is not met.
