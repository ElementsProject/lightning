.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBlistinvoices\fR [\fIlabel\fR] [\fIinvstring\fR] [\fIpayment_hash\fR] [\fIoffer_id\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBlistinvoices\fR RPC command gets the status of a specific invoice,
if it exists, or the status of all invoices if given no argument\.


A specific invoice can be queried by providing either the \fBlabel\fR
provided when creating the invoice, the \fBinvstring\fR string representing
the invoice, the \fBpayment_hash\fR of the invoice, or the local \fBoffer_id\fR
this invoice was issued for\. Only one of the query parameters can be used at once\.
