.SH NAME
lightning-listinvoices - Command for querying invoice status
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBlistinvoices\fR [\fIlabel\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBlistinvoices\fR RPC command gets the status of a specific invoice,
if it exists, or the status of all invoices if given no argument\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success, an array \fIinvoices\fR of objects is returned\. Each object contains
\fIlabel\fR, \fIpayment_hash\fR, \fIstatus\fR (one of \fIunpaid\fR, \fIpaid\fR or \fIexpired\fR),
\fIpayment_preimage\fR (for paid invoices), and \fIexpiry_time\fR (a UNIX
timestamp)\.  If the \fImsatoshi\fR argument to \fBlightning-invoice\fR(7) was not "any",
there will be an \fImsatoshi\fR field as a number, and \fIamount_msat\fR as the same
number ending in \fImsat\fR\. If the invoice \fIstatus\fR is \fIpaid\fR, there will be a
\fIpay_index\fR field and an \fImsatoshi_received\fR field (which may be slightly
greater than \fImsatoshi\fR as some overpaying is permitted to allow clients to
obscure payment paths); there will also be an \fIamount_received_msat\fR field
with the same number as \fImsatoshi_received\fR but ending in \fImsat\fR\.
