NAME
----
lightning-listforwards - Command showing all htlcs and their information.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*listforwards* 

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *listforwards* RPC command displays all htlcs that have been attempted to be forwarded by the c-lightning node.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success one array will be returned: 'forwards' with htlcs that have been processed

Each entry in 'forwards' will include: 

- 'in_channel' - the short_channel_id of the channel that recieved the incoming htlc.

- 'in_msatoshi', 'in_msat' - amount of msatoshis that are forwarded to this node.

- 'status' - status can be either 'offered' if the routing process is still ongoing, 'settled' if the routing process is completed, 'failed' if the routing process could not be completed, or 'local_failed' if the node failed the forward itself.

- 'received_time' - timestamp when incoming htlc was received.

The following additional fields are usually present, but will not be for some
variants of status 'local_failed' (if it failed before we determined these):

- 'fee', 'fee_msat' - fee offered for forwarding the htlc in msatoshi.

- 'out_channel' - the short_channel_id of to which the outgoing htlc is supposed to be forwarded.

- 'out_msatoshi', 'out_msat' - amount of msatoshis to be forwarded.

The following fields may be offered, but for old forgotten HTLCs they will be omitted:

- 'payment_hash' - the payment_hash belonging to the HTLC.

If the status is not 'offered', the following additional fields are present:

- 'resolved_time' - timestamp when htlc was resolved (settled or failed).
