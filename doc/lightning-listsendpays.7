.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBlistsendpays\fR [\fIbolt11\fR] [\fIpayment_hash\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBlistsendpays\fR RPC command gets the status of all \fIsendpay\fR
commands (which is also used by the \fIpay\fR command), or with \fIbolt11\fR or
\fIpayment_hash\fR limits results to that specific payment\. You cannot
specify both\.


Note that in future there may be more than one concurrent \fIsendpay\fR
command per \fIpay\fR, so this command should be used with caution\.

unique internal value assigned at creation


 \fIpayment_hash\fR
the hash of the \fIpayment_preimage\fR which will prove payment\.

 \fIamount_msat\fR
the amount the destination received, in "NNNmsat" format\.


 \fIcreated_at\fR
the UNIX timestamp showing when this payment was initiated\.


 \fIstatus\fR
one of \fIcomplete\fR, \fIfailed\fR or \fIpending\fR\.


 \fIpayment_preimage\fR
(if \fIstatus\fR is \fIcomplete\fR) proves payment was received\.


 \fIlabel\fR
optional \fIlabel\fR, if provided to \fIsendpay\fR\.


 \fIbolt11\fR
the \fIbolt11\fR argument given to \fIpay\fR (may be missing for pre-0\.7
