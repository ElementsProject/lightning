.SH NAME
lightning-listsendpays - Low-level command for querying sendpay status
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBlistsendpays\fR [\fIbolt11\fR] [\fIpayment_hash\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBlistsendpays\fR RPC command gets the status of all \fIsendpay\fR
commands (which is also used by the \fIpay\fR command), or with \fIbolt11\fR or
\fIpayment_hash\fR limits results to that specific payment\. You cannot
specify both\.


Note that in future there may be more than one concurrent \fIsendpay\fR
command per \fIpay\fR, so this command should be used with caution\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

Note that the returned array is ordered by increasing \fIid\fR\.


On success, an object containing \fBpayments\fR is returned\.  It is an array of objects, where each object contains:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
\fBid\fR (u64): unique ID for this payment attempt
.IP \[bu]
\fBpayment_hash\fR (hex): the hash of the \fIpayment_preimage\fR which will prove payment (always 64 characters)
.IP \[bu]
\fBstatus\fR (string): status of the payment (one of "pending", "failed", "complete")
.IP \[bu]
\fBcreated_at\fR (u64): the UNIX timestamp showing when this payment was initiated

\fBamount_msat\fR (msat, optional): The amount delivered to destination (if known)
