The CLN project has a multitude of interfaces, most of which are generated from an abstract schema:

- Wire format for peer-to-peer communication: this is the binary format that is specific by the [LN spec](https://github.com/lightning/bolts). It uses the [generate-wire.py](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/tools/generate-wire.py) script to parse the (faux) CSV files that are automatically extracted from the specification and writes C source code files that are then used internally to encode and decode messages, as well as provide print functions for the messages.

- Wire format for inter-daemon communication: CLN follows a multi-daemon architecture, making communication explicit across daemons. For this inter-daemon communication we use a slightly altered message format from the [LN spec](https://github.com/lightning/bolts). The changes are 
  1. addition of FD passing semantics to allow establishing a new connection between daemons (communication uses [socketpair](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html), so no `connect`)
  2. change the message length prefix from `u16` to `u32`, allowing for messages larger than 65Kb. The CSV files are with the respective sub-daemon and also use [generate-wire.py](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/tools/generate-wire.py) to generate encoding, decoding and printing functions

- We describe the JSON-RPC using [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) in the [`doc/schemas`](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/tree/master/doc/schemas) directory. Each method has a `.request.json` for the request message, and a `.schema.json` for the response (the mismatch is historical and will eventually be addressed). During tests the `pytest` target will verify responses, however the JSON-RPC methods are _not_ generated (yet?). We do generate various client stubs for languages, using the `msggen`][msggen] tool. More on the generated stubs and utilities below.

## Man pages

The manpages are partially generated from the JSON schemas using the [`fromschema`](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/tools/fromschema.py) tool. It reads the request schema and fills in the manpage between two markers:

```markdown
[comment]: # (GENERATE-FROM-SCHEMA-START)
...
[comment]: # (GENERATE-FROM-SCHEMA-END)
```

> Some of this functionality overlaps with [`msggen`](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/tree/master/contrib/msggen) (parsing the Schemas) and [blockreplace.py](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/devtools/blockreplace.py) (filling in the template). It is likely that this will eventually be merged.

## `msggen`

`msggen` is used to generate JSON-RPC client stubs, and converters between in-memory formats and the JSON format. In addition, by chaining some of these we can expose a [grpc](https://grpc.io/) interface that matches the JSON-RPC interface. This conversion chain is implemented in the [grpc-plugin](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/tree/master/plugins/grpc-plugin).

### `cln-rpc`

We use `msggen` to generate the Rust bindings crate [`cln-rpc`](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/tree/master/cln-rpc). These bindings contain the stubs for the JSON-RPC methods, as well as types for the request and response structs. The [generator code](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/contrib/msggen/msggen/gen/rust.py) maps each abstract JSON-RPC type to a Rust type, minimizing size (e.g., binary data is hex-decoded).

The calling pattern follows the `call(req_obj) -> resp_obj` format, and the individual arguments are not expanded. For more ergonomic handling of generic requests and responses we also define the `Request` and `Response` enumerations, so you can hand them to a generic function without having to resort to dynamic dispatch.

The remainder of the crate implements an async/await JSON-RPC client, that can deal with the Unix Domain Socket [transport](ref:lightningd-rpc) used by CLN.

### `cln-grpc`

The `cln-grpc` crate is mostly used to provide the primitives to build the `grpc-plugin`. As mentioned above, the grpc functionality relies on a chain of generated parts:

- First `msggen` is used to generate the [protobuf file](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/cln-grpc/proto/node.proto), containing the service definition with the method stubs, and the types referenced by those stubs.
- Next it generates the `convert.rs` file which is used to convert the structs for in-memory representation from `cln-rpc` into the corresponding protobuf structs.
- Finally `msggen` generates the `server.rs` file which can be bound to a grpc endpoint listening for incoming grpc requests, and it will convert the request and forward it to the JSON-RPC. Upon receiving the response it gets converted back into a grpc response and sent back.
