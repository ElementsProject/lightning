Finally, `lightningd`'s own internal [tests](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/tree/master/tests/plugins) can be a useful (and most reliable) resource.

## Writing a plugin in Rust

[`cln-plugin`](https://docs.rs/cln-plugin/) is a library that facilitates the creation of plugins in Rust, with async/await support, for low-footprint plugins.

## Community built plugins

Check out this [repository](https://github.com/lightningd/plugins#plugin-builder-resources) that has a collection of actively maintained plugins as well as plugin libraries (in your favourite language) built by the community.
