NAME
----
lightning-plugin - Manage plugins with RPC

SYNOPSIS
--------
*plugin* command [parameter] [second_parameter]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *plugin* RPC command allows to manage plugins without having to restart lightningd.
It takes 1 to 3 parameters: a command (start/stop/startdir/reload/list) which describes the
action to take and optionally one or two parameters which describes the plugin on which
the action has to be taken.

The 'start' command takes a path as parameter and will load the plugin available from this
path.
The 'stop' command takes a plugin name as parameter and will kill and unload the specified
plugin.
The 'startdir' command takes a directory path as parameter and will load all plugins this
directory contains.
The 'reload' command starts all not-already-loaded plugins from the default plugins directory
(by default '~/.lightning/plugins').
The 'unregister_hook' command takes a plugin name and a hook name and unregister the hook for
the plugin.
The 'list' command will return all the active plugins.

RETURN VALUE
------------

On success, this returns an object 'plugins' containing a list of all plugins as key, and the
state of the plugin (whether 'active' or 'inactive') as value. Since plugins are configured
asynchronously, a freshly started plugin may not appear immediately.
