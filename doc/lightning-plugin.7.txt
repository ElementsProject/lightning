NAME
----
lightning-plugin - Manage plugins with RPC

SYNOPSIS
--------
*plugin* command [parameter] [second_parameter]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *plugin* RPC command allows to manage plugins without having to restart lightningd.
It takes 1 to 3 parameters: a command (start/stop/startdir/rescan/list) which describes the
action to take and optionally one or two parameters which describes the plugin on which
the action has to be taken.

The 'start' command takes a path as parameter and will load the plugin available from this
path.

The 'stop' command takes a plugin name as parameter and will kill and unload the specified
plugin.

The 'startdir' command takes a directory path as parameter and will load all plugins this
directory contains.

The 'rescan' command starts all not-already-loaded plugins from the default plugins directory
(by default '~/.lightning/plugins').

The 'list' command will return all the active plugins.

RETURN VALUE
------------

On success, this returns an array 'plugins' of objects, one by plugin. Each object contains
the name of the plugin ('name' field) and its status ('active' boolean field).
Since plugins are configured asynchronously, a freshly started plugin may not appear immediately.
