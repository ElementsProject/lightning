.SH NAME
lightning-openchannel_signed - Command to conclude a channel open
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBopenchannel_signed\fR \fIchannel_id\fR \fIsigned_psbt\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBopenchannel_signed\fR is a low level RPC command which concludes a channel
open with the specified peer\. It uses the v2 openchannel protocol, which
allows for interactive transaction construction\.


This command should be called after \fBopenchannel_update\fR returns
\fIcommitments_secured\fR \fBtrue\fR\.


This command will broadcast the finalized funding transaction,
if we receive valid signatures from the peer\.


\fIchannel_id\fR is the id of the channel\.


\fIsigned_psbt\fR is the PSBT returned from \fBopenchannel_update\fR (where
\fIcommitments_secured\fR was true) with partial signatures or finalized
witness stacks included for every input that we contributed to the
PSBT\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success, returns the \fIchannel_id\fR for this channel; hex \fItx\fR of the
published funding transaction; and \fItxid\fR of the funding transaction\.


On error, the returned object will contain \fBcode\fR and \fBmessage\fR properties,
with \fBcode\fR being one of the following:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
-32602: If the given parameters are wrong\.
.IP \[bu]
-1: Catchall nonspecific error\.
.IP \[bu]
303: Funding transaction broadcast failed\.
.IP \[bu]
309: PSBT missing required fields\.
