only be created by something with access to this node's secret key\.


\fImessage\fR must be less that 65536 characters\.

On success, an object is returned, containing:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
\fBsignature\fR (hex): The signature (always 128 characters)
.IP \[bu]
\fBrecid\fR (hex): The recovery id (0, 1, 2 or 3) (always 2 characters)
.IP \[bu]
\fBzbase\fR (string): \fIsignature\fR and \fIrecid\fR encoded in a style compatible with \fBlnd\fR's \fBSignMessageRequest\fR (\fIhttps://api.lightning.community/#grpc-request-signmessagerequest\fR)
