only be created by something with access to this node's secret key\.


\fImessage\fR must be less that 65536 characters\.

.IP \[bu]
\fBsignature\fR (hex): The signature (always 128 characters)

.IP \[bu]
\fBzbase\fR (string): \fIsignature\fR and \fIrecid\fR encoded in a style compatible with \fBlnd\fR's \fBSignMessageRequest\fR (\fIhttps://api.lightning.community/#grpc-request-signmessagerequest\fR)
