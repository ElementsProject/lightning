LIGHTNING-CHECK(7)
==================
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
lightning-check - Command for verifying parameters

SYNOPSIS
--------
*check* 'command_to_check' ['parameters']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *check* RPC command verifies another command's parameters without running it.

The 'command_to_check' is the name of the relevant command.

'parameters' is the command's parameters.

This does not guarantee successful execution of the command in all cases.
For example, a call to lightning-getroute(7) may still fail to find a route even if
checking the parameters succeeds.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, the 'command_to_check' is returned.
On failure, the relevant RPC error is returned.
