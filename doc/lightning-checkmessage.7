.SH NAME
lightning-checkmessage - Command to check if a signature is from a node
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBcheckmessage\fR \fImessage\fR \fIzbase\fR [\fIpubkey\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBcheckmessage\fR RPC command is the counterpart to
\fBsignmessage\fR: given a node id (\fIpubkey\fR), signature (\fIzbase\fR) and a
\fImessage\fR, it verifies that the signature was generated by that node
for that message (more technically: by someone who knows that node's
secret)\.


As a special case, if \fIpubkey\fR is not specified, we will try every
known node key (as per \fIlistnodes\fR), and verification succeeds if it
matches for any one of them\.  Note: this is implemented far more
efficiently than trying each one, so performance is not a concern\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success, an object is returned, containing:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
\fBverified\fR (boolean): Whether the signature was valid

.RE

If \fBverified\fR is \fItrue\fR:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
\fBpubkey\fR (pubkey): the \fIpubkey\fR parameter, or the pubkey found by looking for known nodes

.RE

If \fBverified\fR is \fIfalse\fR:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
\fBpubkey\fR (pubkey): the \fIpubkey\fR (if any) which could have signed this; this is usually not useful!
