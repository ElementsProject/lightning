lightning-fetchinvoice -- Command for fetch an invoice for an offer
===================================================================

SYNOPSIS
--------

**(WARNING: experimental-offers only)**

**fetchinvoice** *offer* [*amount\_msat*] [*quantity*] [*recurrence\_counter*] [*recurrence\_start*] [*recurrence\_label*] [*timeout*] [*payer\_note*]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The **fetchinvoice** RPC command contacts the issuer of an *offer* to get
an actual invoice that can be paid.  It highlights any changes between the
offer and the returned invoice.

If **fetchinvoice-noconnect** is not specified in the configuation, it
will connect to the destination in the (currently common!) case where it
cannot find a route which supports `option_onion_messages`.

The offer must not contain *send\_invoice*; see lightning-sendinvoice(7).

*amount\_msat* is required if the *offer* does not specify
an amount at all, otherwise it is not allowed.

*quantity* is is required if the *offer* specifies
*quantity\_min* or *quantity\_max*, otherwise it is not allowed.

*recurrence\_counter* is required if the *offer*
specifies *recurrence*, otherwise it is not allowed.
*recurrence\_counter* should first be set to 0, and incremented for
each successive invoice in a given series.

*recurrence\_start* is required if the *offer*
specifies *recurrence\_base* with *start\_any\_period* set, otherwise it
is not allowed.  It indicates what period number to start at.

*recurrence\_label* is required if *recurrence\_counter* is set, and
otherwise is not allowed.  It must be the same as prior fetchinvoice
calls for the same recurrence, as it is used to link them together.

*timeout* is an optional timeout; if we don't get a reply before this
we fail (default, 60 seconds).

*payer\_note* is an optional payer note to include in the fetched invoice.

------------
