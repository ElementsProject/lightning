lightning-fetchinvoice -- Command for fetch an invoice for an offer
===================================================================

SYNOPSIS
--------

**(WARNING: experimental-offers only)**

**fetchinvoice** *offer* \[*msatoshi*\] \[*quantity*\] \[*recurrence_counter*\] \[*recurrence_start*\] \[*recurrence_label*\] \[*timeout*\]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The **fetchinvoice** RPC command contacts the issuer of an *offer* to get
an actual invoice that can be paid.  It highlights any changes between the
offer and the returned invoice.

The offer must not contain *send_invoice*; see lightning-sendinvoice(7).

*msatoshi* is required if the *offer* does not specify
an amount at all, otherwise it is not allowed.

*quantity* is is required if the *offer* specifies
*quantity_min* or *quantity_max*, otherwise it is not allowed.

*recurrence_counter* is required if the *offer*
specifies *recurrence*, otherwise it is not allowed.
*recurrence_counter* should first be set to 0, and incremented for
each successive invoice in a given series.

*recurrence_start* is required if the *offer*
specifies *recurrence_base* with *start_any_period* set, otherwise it
is not allowed.  It indicates what period number to start at.

*recurrence_label* is required if *recurrence_counter* is set, and
otherwise is not allowed.  It must be the same as prior fetchinvoice
calls for the same recurrence, as it is used to link them together.

*timeout* is an optional timeout; if we don't get a reply before this
we fail (default, 60 seconds).

RETURN VALUE
------------

On success, an object as follows is returned:

* *invoice*: the bolt12-encoded invoice string, starting with "lni1".
* *changes*: an object detailing changes between the offer and invoice.

Optionally:
* *next_period*: an object returned for recurring invoices if the next 
  period is under the recurrence_limit (if any).
  
The *changes* object can have and of the following members:
* *description_appended*: extra characters appended to the *description* field.
* *description*: a completely replaced *description* field.
* *vendor_removed*": the offer vendor field, which has been omitted from the invoice.
* *vendor*": the offer vendor field, which has changed from the invoice.
* *msat*": the amount, if different from the offer amount multiplied
  by any *quantity* (or the offer had no amount, or was not in BTC).

The *next_period* object has at least the following members:
* *counter*: the index of the next period to be fetchinvoice.
* *starttime*: the time that the next period starts (seconds since 1970)
* *endtime*: the time that the next period ends (seconds since 1970)
* *paywindow_start*: the earliest time that the next invoice can be fetched (seconds since 1970)
* *paywindow_end*: the latest time that the next invoice can be fetched (seconds since 1970)

The following error codes may occur:
- -1: Catchall nonspecific error.
- 1002: Offer has expired.
- 1003: Cannot find a route to the node making the offer.
- 1004: The node making the offer returned an error message.
- 1005: We timed out trying to fetch an invoice.
