NAME
----
lightning-pay - Protocol for sending a payment to a BOLT11 invoice

SYNOPSIS
--------
*pay* 'bolt11' ['msatoshi'] ['description'] ['riskfactor']

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *pay* RPC command attempts to find a route to the given destination,
and send the funds it asks for.  If the 'bolt11' does not contain an amount,
'msatoshi' is required, otherwise if it is specified it must be 'null'.  If
'bolt11' contains a description hash ('h' field) 'description' is
required, otherwise it is unused.  The 'riskfactor' is described in detail
in lightning-getroute(7), and defaults to 1.0.

The response will occur when the payment fails or succeeds.  Once a
payment has succeeded, calls to *pay* with the same 'bolt11' will
succeed immediately.

RETURN VALUE
------------

On success, this returns the payment 'preimage' which hashes to the
'payment_hash' to prove that the payment was successful.
