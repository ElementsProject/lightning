lightning-hsmtool - Tool for working with software HSM secrets of lightningd
.SH SYNOPSIS

lightning-hsmtool method [ARGUMENTS]...

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBlightning-hsmtool\fR performs various operations on the \fBhsm_secret\fR
file used by the software HSM component of \fBlightningd\fR\.


This can be used to encrypt and decrypt the \fBhsm_secret\fR file,
as well as derive secrets used in channel commitments\.

.SH METHODS

 \fBencrypt\fR \fIhsm_secret\fR \fIpassword\fR
Encrypt the \fBhsm_secret\fR file so that it can only be decrypted at
\fBlightningd\fR startup\.
You must give the option \fB--encrypted-hsm\fR to \fBlightningd\fR\.
The password of the \fBhsm_secret\fR file will be asked whenever you
start \fBlightningd\fR\.


 \fBdecrypt\fR \fIhsm_secret\fR \fIpassword\fR
Decrypt the \fBhsm_secret\fR file that was encrypted with the \fBencrypt\fR
method\.


 \fBdumpcommitments\fR \fInode_id\fR \fIchannel_dbid\fR \fIdepth\fR \fIhsm_secret\fR [\fIpassword\fR]
Show the per-commitment secret and point of up to \fIdepth\fR commitments,
of the specified channel with the specified peer,
identified by the channel database index\.
Specify \fIpassword\fR if the \fBhsm_secret\fR is encrypted\.


 \fBguesstoremote\fR \fIp2wpkh\fR \fInode_id\fR \fImax_channel_dbid\fR \fIhsm_secret\fR [\fIpassword\fR]
Brute-force the private key to our funds from a remote unilateral close
of a channel, in a case where we have lost all database data except for
our \fBhsm_secret\fR\.
The peer must be the one to close the channel (and the funds will remain
unrecoverable until the channel is closed)\.
\fImax_channel_dbid\fR is your own guess on what the \fIchannel_dbid\fR was,
or at least the maximum possible value,
and is usually no greater than the number of channels that the node has
ever had\.
Specify \fIpassword\fR if the \fBhsm_secret\fR is encrypted\.

.SH BUGS

You should report bugs on our github issues page, and maybe submit a fix
to gain our eternal gratitude!

this man page, but many others did the hard work of actually implementing
\fBlightning-hsmtool\fR\.
