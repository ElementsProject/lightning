============================================================

SYNOPSIS
--------

**ping** *id* [*len*] [*pongbytes*]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The **ping** command checks if the node with *id* is ready to talk.
It currently only works for peers we have a channel with.

It accepts the following parameters:

- *id*: A string that represents the node id;
- *len*: A integer that represents the length of the ping (default 128);
- *pongbytes*: An integer that represents the length of the reply (default 128).
  A value of 65532 to 65535 means "don't reply".
