lightning-waitanyinvoice -- Command for waiting for payments
============================================================

SYNOPSIS
--------

**waitanyinvoice** \[*lastpay\_index*\] \[*timeout*\]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The **waitanyinvoice** RPC command waits until an invoice is paid, then
returns a single entry as per **listinvoice**. It will not return for
any invoices paid prior to or including the *lastpay\_index*.

This is usually called iteratively: once with no arguments, then
repeatedly with the returned *pay\_index* entry. This ensures that no
paid invoice is missed.

The *pay\_index* is a monotonically-increasing number assigned to an
invoice when it gets paid. The first valid *pay\_index* is 1; specifying
*lastpay\_index* of 0 equivalent to not specifying a *lastpay\_index*.
Negative *lastpay\_index* is invalid.

If *timeout* is specified, wait at most that number of seconds, which
must be an integer.
If the specified *timeout* is reached, this command will return with an
error.
You can specify this to 0 so that **waitanyinvoice** will return
immediately with an error if no pending invoice is available yet.
If unspecified, this command will wait indefinitely.

RETURN VALUE
------------

[comment]: # (GENERATE-FROM-SCHEMA-START)
On success, an object is returned, containing:
- **label** (string): unique label supplied at invoice creation
- **description** (string): description used in the invoice
- **payment_hash** (hex): the hash of the *payment_preimage* which will prove payment (always 64 characters)
- **status** (string): Whether it's paid or expired (one of "paid", "expired")
- **expires_at** (u64): UNIX timestamp of when it will become / became unpayable
- **amount_msat** (msat, optional): the amount required to pay this invoice
- **bolt11** (string, optional): the BOLT11 string (always present unless *bolt12* is)
- **bolt12** (string, optional): the BOLT12 string (always present unless *bolt11* is)

If **status** is "paid":
  - **pay_index** (u64): Unique incrementing index for this payment
  - **amount_received_msat** (msat): the amount actually received (could be slightly greater than *amount_msat*, since clients may overpay)
  - **paid_at** (u64): UNIX timestamp of when it was paid
  - **payment_preimage** (hex): proof of payment (always 64 characters)
