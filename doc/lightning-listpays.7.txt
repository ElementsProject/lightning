LIGHTNING-LISTPAYS(7)
=====================
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
lightning-listpays - Command for querying payment status

SYNOPSIS
--------
*listpays* [bolt11]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *listpay* RPC command gets the status of all 'pay' commands, or a single
one if 'bolt11' is specified.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, an array of objects is returned.  Each object contains:

'bolt11':: the 'bolt11' argument given to 'pay' (see below for exceptions).
'status':: one of 'complete', 'failed' or 'pending'.
'payment_preimage':: (if 'status' is 'complete') proves payment was received.
'label':: optional 'label', if provided to 'pay'.
'amount_sent_msat':: total amount sent, in "NNNmsat" format.

For old payments (pre-0.7) we didn't save the 'bolt11' string, so in
its place are three other fields:

'payment_hash':: the hash of the 'payment_preimage' which will prove payment.
'destination':: the final destination of the payment.
'amount_msat':: the amount the destination received, in "NNNmsat" format.

These three can all be extracted from 'bolt11', hence are obsolete.
