lightning-listpeerchannels -- Command returning data on channels of connected lightning nodes
==========================================================================

SYNOPSIS
--------

**listpeerchannels** \[*id*\]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The **listpeerchannels** RPC command returns data on channels of the network, with the possibility to filter the channels by node id.

If no *id* is supplied, then channel data on all lightning nodes that are
connected, or not connected but have open channels with this node, are
returned.

Supplying *id* will filter the results to only return channel data that match *id*,
if one exists.

RETURN VALUE
------------

  - **amount\_msat** (msat): Amount send/received for this HTLC
  - **expiry** (u32): Block this HTLC expires at (after which an `in` direction HTLC will be returned to the peer, an `out` returned to us).  If this expiry is too close, lightningd(8) will automatically unilaterally close the channel in order to enforce the timeout onchain.
  - **payment\_hash** (hash): the hash of the payment\_preimage which will prove payment
  - **local\_trimmed** (boolean, optional): If this is too small to enforce onchain; it doesn't appear in the commitment transaction and will not be enforced in a unilateral close.

[comment]: # (GENERATE-FROM-SCHEMA-END)

The *state* field values (and *old\_state* / *new\_state*) are worth describing further:

  * `"OPENINGD"`: The channel funding protocol with the peer is ongoing
    and both sides are negotiating parameters.
  * `"DUALOPEND_OPEN_INIT"`: Like `OPENINGD`, but for v2 connections which
    are using collaborative opens.
  * `"CHANNELD_AWAITING_LOCKIN"` / `"DUALOPEND\_AWAITING\_LOCKIN"`: The peer and you have agreed on channel
    parameters and are just waiting for the channel funding transaction to
    be confirmed deeply (original and collaborative open protocols, respectively).
    Both you and the peer must acknowledge the channel funding transaction
    to be confirmed deeply before entering the next state.
	Also, you can increase the onchain fee for channels in `DUALOPEND\_AWAITING\_LOCKIN`
	using lightning-openchannel\_bump(7).
  * `"CHANNELD_NORMAL"`: The channel can be used for normal payments.
  * `"CHANNELD_SHUTTING_DOWN"`: A mutual close was requested (by you or
    peer) and both of you are waiting for HTLCs in-flight to be either
    failed or succeeded.
    The channel can no longer be used for normal payments and forwarding.
    Mutual close will proceed only once all HTLCs in the channel have
    either been fulfilled or failed.
  * `"CLOSINGD_SIGEXCHANGE"`: You and the peer are negotiating the mutual
    close onchain fee.
  * `"CLOSINGD_COMPLETE"`: You and the peer have agreed on the mutual close
    onchain fee and are awaiting the mutual close getting confirmed deeply.
  * `"AWAITING_UNILATERAL"`: You initiated a unilateral close, and are now
    waiting for the peer-selected unilateral close timeout to complete.
  * `"FUNDING_SPEND_SEEN"`: You saw the funding transaction getting
    spent (usually the peer initiated a unilateral close) and will now
    determine what exactly happened (i.e. if it was a theft attempt).
  * `"ONCHAIN"`: You saw the funding transaction getting spent and now
    know what happened (i.e. if it was a proper unilateral close by the
    peer, or a theft attempt).

On error the returned object will contain `code` and `message` properties,
with `code` being one of the following:

- -32602: If the given parameters are wrong.
