.SH NAME
lightning-listpeers - Command returning data on connected lightning nodes
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBlistpeers\fR [\fIid\fR] [\fIlevel\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBlistpeers\fR RPC command returns data on nodes that are connected
or are not connected but have open channels with this node\.


Once a connection to another lightning node has been established, using
the \fBconnect\fR command, data on the node can be returned using
\fBlistpeers\fR and the \fIid\fR that was used with the \fBconnect\fR command\.


If no \fIid\fR is supplied, then data on all lightning nodes that are
connected, or not connected but have open channels with this node, are
returned\.


Supplying \fIid\fR will filter the results to only return data on a node
with a matching \fIid\fR, if one exists\.


Supplying \fIlevel\fR will show log entries related to that peer at the
given log level\. Valid log levels are "io", "debug", "info", and
"unusual"\.


If a channel is open with a node and the connection has been lost, then
the node will still appear in the output of the command and the value of
the \fIconnected\fR attribute of the node will be "false"\.


The channel will remain open for a set blocktime, after which if the
connection has not been re-established, the channel will close and the
node will no longer appear in the command output\.

The objects in the \fIchannels\fR array will have at least these fields:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
\fIstate\fR: Any of these strings:
.RS
.IP \[bu]
\fB"OPENINGD"\fR: The channel funding protocol with the peer is ongoing
and both sides are negotiating parameters\.
.IP \[bu]
\fB"CHANNELD_AWAITING_LOCKIN"\fR: The peer and you have agreed on channel
parameters and are just waiting for the channel funding transaction to
be confirmed deeply\.
Both you and the peer must acknowledge the channel funding transaction
to be confirmed deeply before entering the next state\.
.IP \[bu]
\fB"CHANNELD_NORMAL"\fR: The channel can be used for normal payments\.
.IP \[bu]
\fB"CHANNELD_SHUTTING_DOWN"\fR: A mutual close was requested (by you or

These fields may exist if the channel has gotten beyond the \fB"OPENINGD"\fR
state, or in various circumstances:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
\fIshort_channel_id\fR: A string of the short channel ID for the channel;
Format is \fB"BBBBxTTTxOOO"\fR, where \fB"BBBB"\fR is the numeric block height
at which the funding transaction was confirmed, \fB"TTT"\fR is the numeric
funding transaction index within that block, and \fB"OOO"\fR is the
numeric output index of the transaction output that actually anchors
this channel\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIdirection\fR: The channel-direction we own, as per  BOLT #7\.
We own channel-direction 0 if our node ID is "less than" the peer node ID
in a lexicographical ordering of our node IDs, otherwise we own
channel-direction 1\.
Our \fBchannel_update\fR will use this \fIdirection\fR\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIchannel_id\fR: The full channel ID of the channel;
the funding transaction ID XORed with the output number\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIfunding_txid\fR: The funding transaction ID of the channel\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIclose_to\fR: The raw \fBscriptPubKey\fR that was indicated in the starting
\fBfundchannel_start\fR command and accepted by the peer\.
If the \fBscriptPubKey\fR encodes a standardized address, an additional
\fIclose_to_addr\fR field will be present with the standardized address\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIprivate\fR: A boolean, true if the channel is unpublished, false if the
channel is published\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIfunding_msat\fR: An object, whose field names are the node
IDs involved in the channel, and whose values are strings (numbers with
a unit suffix) indicating how much that node originally contributed in
opening the channel\.
.IP \[bu]
\fImin_to_us_msat\fR: A string describing the historic point at which
we owned the least amount of funds in this channel;
a number followed by a string unit\.
If the peer were to succesfully steal from us, this is the amount we
would still retain\.
.IP \[bu]
\fImax_to_us_msat\fR: A string describing the historic point at which
we owned the most amount of funds in this channel;
a number followed by a string unit\.
If we were to successfully steal from the peer, this is the amount we
could potentially get\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIdust_limit_msat\fR: A string describing an amount;
if an HTLC or the amount wholly-owned by one node is at or below this
amount, it will be considered "dusty" and will not appear in a close
transaction, and will be donated to miners as fee;
a number followed by a string unit\.
.IP \[bu]
\fImax_total_htlc_in_msat\fR: A string describing an amount;
the sum of all HTLCs in the channel cannot exceed this amount;
a number followed by a string unit\.
.IP \[bu]
\fItheir_reserve_msat\fR: A string describing the minimum amount that
the peer must keep in the channel when it attempts to send out;
if it has less than this in the channel, it cannot send to us on
that channel;
a number followed by a string unit\.
We impose this on them, default is 1% of the total channel capacity\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIour_reserve_msat\fR: A string describing the minimum amount that
you must keep in the channel when you attempt to send out;
if you have less than this in the channel, you cannot send out
via this channel;
a number followed by a string unit\.
The peer imposes this on us, default is 1% of the total channel capacity\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIspendable_msat\fR and \fIreceivable_msat\fR: A string describing an
\fB\fIestimate\fR\fR of how much we can send or receive over this channel in a
single payment (or payment-part for multi-part payments);
a number followed by a string unit\.
This is an \fB\fIestimate\fR\fR, which can be wrong because adding HTLCs requires
an increase in fees paid to onchain miners, and onchain fees change
dynamically according to onchain activity\.
For a sufficiently-large channel, this can be limited by the rules imposed
under certain blockchains;
for example, individual Bitcoin mainnet payment-parts cannot exceed
42\.94967295 mBTC\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIminimum_htlc_in_msat\fR: A string describing the minimum amount that
an HTLC must have before we accept it\.

.IP \[bu]

.IP \[bu]
\fIamount_msat\fR: The value of the HTLC\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIexpiry\fR: The blockheight at which the HTLC will be forced to return
to its offerer: an \fB"in"\fR HTLC will be returned to the peer, an
\fB"out"\fR HTLC will be returned to you\.
\fBNOTE\fR If the \fIexpiry\fR of any outgoing HTLC will arrive in the next
block, \fBlightningd\fR(8) will automatically unilaterally close the
channel in order to enforce the timeout onchain\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIpayment_hash\fR: The payment hash, whose preimage must be revealed to
successfully claim this HTLC\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIstate\fR: A string describing whether the HTLC has been communicated to

the previous commitment (that does not contain it) has been revoked, as
well as when the HTLC is fulfilled or failed offchain\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIlocal_trimmed\fR: A boolean, existing and \fBtrue\fR if the HTLC is not
actually instantiated as an output (i\.e\. "trimmed") on the commitment
transaction (and will not be instantiated on a unilateral close)\.
Generally true if the HTLC is below the \fIdust_limit_msat\fR for the
channel\.

On error the returned object will contain \fBcode\fR and \fBmessage\fR properties,
