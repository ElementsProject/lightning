.SH NAME
lightning-listpeers - Command returning data on connected lightning nodes
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBlistpeers\fR [\fIid\fR] [\fIlevel\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBlistpeers\fR RPC command returns data on nodes that are connected
or are not connected but have open channels with this node\.


Once a connection to another lightning node has been established, using
the \fBconnect\fR command, data on the node can be returned using
\fBlistpeers\fR and the \fIid\fR that was used with the \fBconnect\fR command\.


If no \fIid\fR is supplied, then data on all lightning nodes that are
connected, or not connected but have open channels with this node, are
returned\.


Supplying \fIid\fR will filter the results to only return data on a node
with a matching \fIid\fR, if one exists\.


Supplying \fIlevel\fR will show log entries related to that peer at the
given log level\. Valid log levels are "io", "debug", "info", and
"unusual"\.


If a channel is open with a node and the connection has been lost, then
the node will still appear in the output of the command and the value of
the \fIconnected\fR attribute of the node will be "false"\.


The channel will remain open for a set blocktime, after which if the
connection has not been re-established, the channel will close and the
node will no longer appear in the command output\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success, an object with a "peers" key is returned containing a list
of 0 or more objects\.


Each object in the list contains the following data:

.IP \[bu]
\fIid\fR : The unique id of the peer
.IP \[bu]
\fIconnected\fR : A boolean value showing the connection status
.IP \[bu]
\fInetaddr\fR : A list of network addresses the node is listening on
.IP \[bu]
\fIglobalfeatures\fR : Bit flags showing supported global features (BOLT #9)
.IP \[bu]
\fIlocalfeatures\fR : Bit flags showing supported local features (BOLT #9)
.IP \[bu]
\fIchannels\fR : An list of channel idâ€™s open on the peer
.IP \[bu]
\fIlog\fR : Only present if \fIlevel\fR is set\. List logs related to the
peer at the specified \fIlevel\fR


If \fIid\fR is supplied and no matching nodes are found, a "peers" object
with an empty list is returned\.

.SH ERRORS

If \fIid\fR is not a valid public key, an error message will be returned:

.nf
.RS
{ "code" : -32602, "message" : "'id' should be a pubkey, not '...'" }


.RE

.fi

If \fIlevel\fR is not a valid log level, an error message will be returned:

.nf
.RS
{ "code" : -32602, "message" "'level' should be 'io', 'debug', 'info', or 'unusual', not '...'" }
