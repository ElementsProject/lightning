lightning-autoclean-once -- A single deletion of old invoices/payments/forwards
===============================================================================

SYNOPSIS
--------

**autoclean-once** *subsystem* *age*

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The **autoclean-once** RPC command tell the `autoclean` plugin to do a
single sweep to delete old entries.  This is a manual alternative (or
addition) to the various `autoclean-...-age` parameters which
cause autoclean to run once per hour: see lightningd-config(5).

The *subsystem*s currently supported are:

* `failedforwards`: routed payments which did not succeed (`failed` or `local_failed` in listforwards `status`).
* `succeededforwards`: routed payments which succeeded (`settled` in listforwards `status`).
* `failedpays`: payment attempts which did not succeed (`failed` in listpays `status`).
* `succededpays`: payment attempts which succeeded (`complete` in listpays `status`).
* `expiredinvoices`: invoices which were not paid (and cannot be) (`expired` in listinvoices `status`).
* `paidinvoices`: invoices which were paid (`paid` in listinvoices `status).

*age* is a non-zero number in seconds.
