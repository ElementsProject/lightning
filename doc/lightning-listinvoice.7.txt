NAME
----
lightning-listinvoice - Protocol for querying invoice status

SYNOPSIS
--------
*listinvoice* ['label']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *listinvoice* RPC command gets the status of a specific invoice, if
it exists, or the status of all invoices if given no argument.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, an array 'invoices' of objects is returned.  Each object contains 'label', 'rhash', 'complete' (a boolean), and 'expiry_time' (a UNIX timestamp).  If the 'msatoshi' argument to lightning-invoice(7) was not "any", there will be an 'msatoshi' field. If the invoice has been paid, there will be a 'pay_index' field.
