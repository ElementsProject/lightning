.SH NAME
lightning-fundchannel_complete - Command for completing channel establishment
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBfundchannel_complete\fR \fIid\fR \fIpsbt\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBfundchannel_complete\fR is a lower level RPC command\. It allows a user to
complete an initiated channel establishment with a connected peer\.


\fIid\fR is the node id of the remote peer\.


\fIpsbt\fR is the transaction to use for funding (does not need to be
signed but must be otherwise complete)\.


Note that the funding transaction MUST NOT be broadcast until after
channel establishment has been successfully completed, as the commitment
transactions for this channel are not secured until this command
successfully completes\. Broadcasting transaction before can lead to
unrecoverable loss of funds\.

derived \fIchannel_id\fR\.


On error the returned object will contain \fBcode\fR and \fBmessage\fR properties,
