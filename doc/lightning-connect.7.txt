LIGHTNING-CONNECT(7)
====================
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
lightning-connect - Command for connecting to another 
lightning node.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*connect* 'node_id'[@('ip_addr'|'hostname')[:'port']]

or

*connect* 'node_id'[ ('ip_addr'|'hostname')[:'port']]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *connect* RPC command establishes a new connection 
with another node in the Lightning Network.

'node_id' represents the target node's public key and 
'ip_addr' can be either IPv4 or IPv6. 

If not specified the 'port' is assumed to be 9375 
(default lightning port).

If neither 'ip_addr' or 'hostname' is specified, 
connection will be attempted to an IP belonging to 
'node_id' learned through gossip with other already 
connected peers

Connecting to a node is just the first step in opening 
a channel with another node, once the peer is connected
a channel can be opened with lightning-fundchannel(7)


RETURN VALUE
------------
On success the response will include just the peer id 
(peer's public key)

ERRORS
------
If 'node_id' or 'ip_addr' are invalid or if 'hostname' 
can't be resolved to a valid IP address an error message
will be returned. An error will also be returned if the 
simplified version (only 'node_id') is used and there's
no published IP for the peer. *connect* will make up to 
10(?) attempts to connect to the peer before giving up
