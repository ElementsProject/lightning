LIGHTNING-INVOICE(7)
====================
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
lightning-invoice - Protocol for accepting payments.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*invoice* 'msatoshi' 'label'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *invoice* RPC command creates the expectation of a payment of a
given amount of milli-satoshi: it returns a unique token which another
lightning daemon can use to pay this invoice.

The 'label' must be unique; it is never revealed to other nodes on
the lightning network, but it can be used to query the status of this
invoice.

RETURN VALUE
------------

On success, a hash is returned as 'rhash' to be given to the payer.
On failure, an error is returned and no invoice is created.  If the
lightning process fails before responding, the caller should use
getinvoice(7) to query whether this invoice was created or not.

//FIXME:Enumerate errors
