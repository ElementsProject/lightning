.IP \[bu]
\fItxid\fR
.IP \[bu]
\fIoutput\fR (the index of the output in the transaction)
.IP \[bu]
\fIvalue\fR (the output value in satoshis)
.IP \[bu]
\fIamount_msat\fR (the same as \fIvalue\fR, but in millisatoshi with \fImsat\fR

\fImsat\fR appended\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIchannel_total_sat\fR - total channel value in satoshi
