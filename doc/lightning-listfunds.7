.SH NAME
lightning-listfunds - Command showing all funds currently managed by the c-lightning node
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBlistfunds\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBlistfunds\fR RPC command displays all funds available, either in
unspent outputs (UTXOs) in the internal wallet or funds locked in
currently open channels\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success three arrays will be returned: \fIoutputs\fR with funds currently
locked onchain in UTXOs, \fIreserved_outputs\fR of outputs currently in the wallet
but internally reserved for a transaction, and \fIchannels\fR with funds readily spendable in
channels\.


Each entry in \fIoutputs\fR and \fIreserved_outputs\fR will include:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
\fItxid\fR
.IP \[bu]
\fIoutput\fR (the index of the output in the transaction)
.IP \[bu]
\fIvalue\fR (the output value in satoshis)
.IP \[bu]
\fIamount_msat\fR (the same as \fIvalue\fR, but in millisatoshi with \fImsat\fR
appended)
.IP \[bu]
\fIaddress\fR
.IP \[bu]
\fIstatus\fR (whether \fIunconfirmed\fR, \fIconfirmed\fR, or \fIspent\fR)
.IP \[bu]
\fIblockheight\fR (block the transaction is in, if confirmed)
.IP \[bu]
\fIspend_priority\fR (used internally when funding new transactions)

.RE

Each \fIreserved_outputs\fR entry might include: 

.RS
.IP \[bu]
\fIreserved_at_height\fR (blockheight at which expiring reservation was placed on output)
.IP \[bu]
\fIreserved_until\fR (number of blocks for which reservation is valid)
.IP \[bu]
\fIreservation_expired\fR (true if reservation has expired, is eligible to spend)

.RE

Each entry in \fIchannels\fR will include:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
\fIpeer_id\fR - the peer with which the channel is opened\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIshort_channel_id\fR - as per BOLT 7 (representing the block,
transaction number and output index of the channel funding
transaction)\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIchannel_sat\fR - available satoshis on our nodeâ€™s end of the channel
(values rounded down to satoshis as internal storage is in
millisatoshi)\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIour_amount_msat\fR - same as above, but in millisatoshis with
\fImsat\fR appended\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIchannel_total_sat\fR - total channel value in satoshi
.IP \[bu]
\fIamount_msat\fR - same as above, but in millisatoshis with \fImsat\fR
appended\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIfunding_txid\fR - funding transaction id\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIfunding_output\fR - the index of the output in the funding
transaction\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIconnected\fR - whether the channel peer is connected\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIstate\fR - the channel state, in particular \fICHANNELD_NORMAL\fR means the
channel can be used normally\.
