.SH NAME
lightning-listfunds - Command showing all funds currently managed by the c-lightning node
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBlistfunds\fR [\fIspent\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBlistfunds\fR RPC command displays all funds available, either in
unspent outputs (UTXOs) in the internal wallet or funds locked in
currently open channels\.


\fIspent\fR is a boolean: if true, then the \fIoutputs\fR will include spent outputs
in addition to the unspent ones\. Default is false\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success two arrays will be returned: \fIoutputs\fR with funds currently
locked onchain in UTXOs and \fIchannels\fR with funds readily spendable in
channels\.


Each entry in \fIoutputs\fR will include:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
\fItxid\fR
.IP \[bu]
\fIoutput\fR (the index of the output in the transaction)
.IP \[bu]
\fIvalue\fR (the output value in satoshis)
.IP \[bu]
\fIamount_msat\fR (the same as \fIvalue\fR, but in millisatoshi with \fImsat\fR
appended)
.IP \[bu]
\fIaddress\fR
.IP \[bu]
\fIscriptpubkey\fR (the ScriptPubkey of the output, in hex)
.IP \[bu]
\fIredeemscript\fR (the redeemscript of the output, in hex, only if it's p2sh-wrapped)
.IP \[bu]
\fIstatus\fR (whether \fIunconfirmed\fR, \fIconfirmed\fR, or \fIspent\fR)
.IP \[bu]
\fIreserved\fR (whether this is UTXO is currently reserved for an in-flight tx)
.IP \[bu]
\fIreserved_to_block\fR (when reservation expires, if \fIreserved\fR is true)

.RE

Each entry in \fIchannels\fR will include:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
\fIpeer_id\fR - the peer with which the channel is opened\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIshort_channel_id\fR - as per BOLT 7 (representing the block,
transaction number and output index of the channel funding
transaction)\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIchannel_sat\fR - available satoshis on our nodeâ€™s end of the channel
(values rounded down to satoshis as internal storage is in
millisatoshi)\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIour_amount_msat\fR - same as above, but in millisatoshis with
\fImsat\fR appended\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIchannel_total_sat\fR - total channel value in satoshi
.IP \[bu]
\fIamount_msat\fR - same as above, but in millisatoshis with \fImsat\fR
appended\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIfunding_txid\fR - funding transaction id\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIfunding_output\fR - the index of the output in the funding
transaction\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIconnected\fR - whether the channel peer is connected\.
.IP \[bu]
\fIstate\fR - the channel state, in particular \fICHANNELD_NORMAL\fR means the
channel can be used normally\.
