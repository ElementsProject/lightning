[comment]: # (GENERATE-FROM-SCHEMA-END)

Technically, the *description* field is optional if a
*description\_hash* field is given, but in this case **decodepay** will
only succeed if the optional *description* field is passed and matches
the *description\_hash*. In practice, these are currently unused.
