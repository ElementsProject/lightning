.SH NAME
lightning-utxopsbt - Command to populate PSBT inputs from given UTXOs
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fButxopsbt\fR \fIsatoshi\fR \fIfeerate\fR \fIstartweight\fR \fIutxos\fR [\fIreserve\fR] [\fIreservedok\fR] [\fIlocktime\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fIutxopsbt\fR is a low-level RPC command which creates a PSBT using unreserved
inputs in the wallet, optionally reserving them as well\.


It deliberately mirrors the parameters and output of
\fBlightning-fundpsbt\fR(7) except instead of an optional \fIminconf\fR
parameter to select unreserved outputs from the wallet, it takes a
compulsory list of outputs to use\.


\fIutxos\fR must be an array of "txid:vout", each of which must be
reserved or available: the total amount must be sufficient to pay for
the resulting transaction plus \fIstartweight\fR at the given \fIfeerate\fR,
with at least \fIsatoshi\fR left over (unless \fIsatoshi\fR is \fBall\fR, which
is equivalent to setting it to zero)\.


Unless \fIreservedok\fR is set to true (default is false) it will also fail
if any of the \fIutxos\fR are already reserved\.


\fIlocktime\fR is an optional locktime: if not set, it is set to a recent
block height\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success, returns the \fIpsbt\fR containing the inputs, \fIfeerate_per_kw\fR
showing the exact numeric feerate it used, \fIestimated_final_weight\fR for
the estimated weight of the transaction once fully signed, and
\fIexcess_msat\fR containing the amount above \fIsatoshi\fR which is
available\.  This could be zero, or dust\.  If \fIsatoshi\fR was "all",
then \fIexcess_msat\fR is the entire amount once fees are subtracted
for the weights of the inputs and \fIstartweight\fR\.


If \fIreserve\fR was true, then a \fIreservations\fR array is returned,
exactly like \fIreserveinputs\fR\.


On error the returned object will contain \fBcode\fR and \fBmessage\fR properties,
with \fBcode\fR being one of the following:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
-32602: If the given parameters are wrong\.
.IP \[bu]
-1: Catchall nonspecific error\.
.IP \[bu]
301: Insufficient UTXOs to meet \fIsatoshi\fR value\.
