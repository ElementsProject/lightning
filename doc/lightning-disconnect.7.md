lightning-disconnect -- Command for disconnecting from another lightning node
=============================================================================

SYNOPSIS
--------

**disconnect** *id* \[*force*\]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The disconnect RPC command closes an existing connection to a peer,
identified by *id*, in the Lightning Network, as long as it doesnâ€™t have
an active channel. If *force* is set then it will disconnect even with
an active channel.

The *id* can be discovered in the output of the listpeers command, which
returns a set of peers:

    {
         "peers": [
              {
                   "id": "0563aea81...",
                   "connected": true,
                   ...
              }
         ]
    }

Passing the *id* attribute of a peer to *disconnect* will terminate the
connection.

RETURN VALUE
------------
