.SH NAME


lightning-connect - Command for connecting to another lightning node\.

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBconnect\fR \fIid\fR [\fIhost\fR \fIport\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBconnect\fR RPC command establishes a new connection with another
node in the Lightning Network\.


\fIid\fR represents the target node’s public key\. As a convenience, \fIid\fR may
be of the form \fIid@host\fR or \fIid@host:port\fR\. In this case, the \fIhost\fR and
\fIport\fR parameters must be omitted\.


\fIhost\fR is the peer’s hostname or IP address\.


If not specified, the \fIport\fR defaults to 9735\.


If \fIhost\fR is not specified, the connection will be attempted to an IP
belonging to \fIid\fR obtained through gossip with other already connected
peers\.


If \fIhost\fR begins with a \fI/\fR it is interpreted as a local path, and the
connection will be made to that local socket (see \fBbind-addr\fR in
\fBlightningd-config\fR(5))\.


Connecting to a node is just the first step in opening a channel with
another node\. Once the peer is connected a channel can be opened with
\fBlightning-fundchannel\fR(7)\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success the peer \fIid\fR is returned\.


The following error codes may occur:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
-1: Catchall nonspecific error\. This may occur if the host is not
valid or there are problems communicating with the peer\. \fBconnect\fR
will make up to 10 attempts to connect to the peer before giving up\.
