lightning-sendinvoice -- Command for send an invoice for an offer
=================================================================

SYNOPSIS
--------

**(WARNING: experimental-offers only)**

**sendinvoice** *invreq* *label* [*amount\_msat*] [*timeout*] [*quantity*]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The **sendinvoice** RPC command creates and sends an invoice to the
issuer of an *invoice\_request* for it to pay: lightning-invoicerequest(7).

If **fetchinvoice-noconnect** is not specified in the configuation, it
will connect to the destination in the (currently common!) case where it
cannot find a route which supports `option_onion_messages`.

RETURN VALUE
------------

[comment]: # (GENERATE-FROM-SCHEMA-START)
On success, an object is returned, containing:

- **label** (string): unique label supplied at invoice creation
- **description** (string): description used in the invoice
- **payment\_hash** (hash): the hash of the *payment\_preimage* which will prove payment
- **status** (string): Whether it's paid, unpaid or unpayable (one of "unpaid", "paid", "expired")
- **expires\_at** (u64): UNIX timestamp of when it will become / became unpayable
- **created\_index** (u64): 1-based index indicating order this invoice was created in *(added v23.08)*
- **amount\_msat** (msat, optional): the amount required to pay this invoice
- **bolt12** (string, optional): the BOLT12 string
- **updated\_index** (u64, optional): 1-based index indicating order this invoice was changed (only present if it has changed since creation) *(added v23.08)*

If **status** is "paid":

  - **pay\_index** (u64): Unique incrementing index for this payment
  - **amount\_received\_msat** (msat): the amount actually received (could be slightly greater than *amount\_msat*, since clients may overpay)
  - **paid\_at** (u64): UNIX timestamp of when it was paid
  - **payment\_preimage** (secret): proof of payment
