.SH NAME
lightning-fundchannel_start - Command for initiating channel establishment for a lightning channel
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBfundchannel_start\fR \fIid\fR \fIamount\fR [\fIfeerate\fR \fIannounce\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBfundchannel_start\fR is a lower level RPC command\. It allows a user to
initiate channel establishment with a connected peer\.


\fIid\fR is the node id of the remote peer\.


\fIamount\fR is the satoshi value that the channel will be funded at\. This
value MUST be accurate, otherwise the negotiated commitment transactions
will not encompass the correct channel value\.


\fIfeerate\fR is an optional field\. Sets the feerate for subsequent
commitment transactions\.


\fIannounce\fR whether or not to announce this channel\.


Note that the funding transaction MUST NOT be broadcast until after
channel establishment has been successfully completed by running
\fBfundchannel_complete\fR, as the commitment transactions for this channel
are not secured until the complete command succeeds\. Broadcasting
transaction before that can lead to unrecoverable loss of funds\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success, returns the \fIfunding_address\fR and the \fIscriptpubkey\fR for the channel funding output\.


On failure, returns an error\.
