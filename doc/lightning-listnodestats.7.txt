NAME
----
lightning-listnodestats - Protocol for querying node-level statistics

SYNOPSIS
--------
*listnodestats* ['id']

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *listnodestats* RPC command returns some node statistics and
counters for nodes known by this node.

If the 'id' is specified, information about the specific node is
returned; the returned array is an array with a single element.
If the specified 'id' is not found in the node statistics database,
an error is returned.

The command is intended, to provide information to automated
programmable channel managers ("pilots") to help their
heuristics judge good nodes to fund channels to and judge
bad nodes to close channels with.

RETURN VALUE
------------

On success, an object with a field 'nodestats' is returned.
This field is an array of objects.
Each object contains:

* 'index' - an arbitrary numeric index unique for each node.
* 'nodeid' - the public key (id) of the node, as a string.
* 'time_first_seen' - the earliest time, as a Unix Epoch number,
  that we saw this node alive.
  Can be usd 
* 'time_last_seen' - the latest time, as a Unix Epoch number,
  that we saw this node alive.
* 'forwarding_failures' - the number of times, that a payment
  we made failed to reach the destination because this node
  caused a failure.
* 'connect_failures' - the number of times, that we gave up
  on trying to connect to this node.
* 'channel_failures' - the number of times, that a channel with
  this node was closed due to an error on either side.

If an 'id' is specified but is not found in the node statistics
table, an error is returned.
