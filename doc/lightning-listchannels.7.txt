LIGHTNING-LISTCHANNELS(7)
=======================
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
lightning-listchannels - Command to query active lightning channels in the entire network.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*listchannels* ['short_channel_id'] ['source']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *listchannels* RPC command returns data on channels that are known to the
node.  Because channels may be bidirectional, up to 2 objects will be returned
for each channel (one for each direction).

If 'short_channel_id' is supplied, then only known channels with a
matching 'short_channel_id' are returned.

If 'source' is supplied, then only channels leading from that node id
are returned.

If neither is supplied, data on all lightning channels known to this
node, are returned.  These can be local channels or public channels
broadcast on the gossip network.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, an object with a "channels" key is returned containing a list of 0
or more objects.

Each object in the list contains the following data:

- 'source' : The node providing entry to the channel, specifying the fees
charged for using the channel in that direction.
- 'destination' : The node providing the exit point for the channel.
- 'short_channel_id' : The channel identifier.
- 'public' : Boolean value, is publicly available.  Non-local channels will only
ever have this value set to true.  Local channels are side-loaded by this node,
rather than obtained through the gossip network, and so may have this value set
to false.
- 'satoshis' : Funds available in the channel.
- 'message_flags' : Bitfield showing the presence of optional fields in the
'channel_update' message (BOLT #7).
- 'channel_flags' : Bitfields indicating the direction of the channel and
signaling various options concerning the channel. (BOLT #7).
- 'active' : Boolean value, is available for routing.  This is linked to the
channel flags data, where if the second bit is set, signals a channels
temporary unavailability (due to loss of connectivity) OR permanent
unavailability where the channel has been closed but not settlement on-chain.	
- 'last_update' : Unix timestamp (seconds) showing when the last channel_update
message was received.
- 'base_fee_millisatoshi' : The base fee (in millisatoshi) charged for the
HTLC (BOLT #2).
- 'fee_per_millionth' : The amount (in millionths of a satoshi) charged per
transferred satoshi (BOLT #2).
- 'delay' : The number of blocks delay required to wait for on-chain settlement
when unilaterally closing the channel (BOLT #2).

If 'short_channel_id' or 'source' is supplied and no matching channels
are found, a "channels" object with an empty list is returned.

ERRORS
------
If 'short_channel_id' is not a valid short_channel_id, an error message will be
returned:

----
{ "code" : -32602,
  "message" : "'short_channel_id' should be a short channel id, not '...'" }
----

Similarly if 'source' is not a valid pubkey.
