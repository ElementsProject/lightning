.SH NAME
lightning-txprepare - Command to prepare to withdraw funds from the internal wallet
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBtxprepare\fR \fIdestination\fR \fIsatoshi\fR [\fIfeerate\fR] [\fIminconf\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBtxprepare\fR RPC command creates an unsigned transaction which
spends funds from c-lightningâ€™s internal wallet to the address specified
in \fIdestination\fR\.


Effectively, it is the first part of a \fBwithdraw\fR command, and uses
the same parameters\. The second part is provided by \fBtxsend\fR\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success, an object with attributes \fIunsigned_tx\fR and \fItxid\fR will be
returned\. You need to hand \fItxid\fR to \fBtxsend\fR or \fBtxdiscard\fR, as the
inputs of this transaction are reserved until then, or until the daemon
restarts\.


\fIunsigned_tx\fR represents the raw bitcoin transaction (not yet signed)
and \fItxid\fR represent the bitcoin transaction id\.


On failure, an error is reported and the transaction is not created\.


The following error codes may occur:

.IP \[bu]
-1: Catchall nonspecific error\.
.IP \[bu]
301: There are not enough funds in the internal wallet (including
fees) to create the transaction\.
.IP \[bu]
302: The dust limit is not met\.
