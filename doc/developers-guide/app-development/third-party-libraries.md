## JSON over HTTPS

[Sparko](https://github.com/fiatjaf/sparko) offers a full-blown JSON-RPC over HTTP bridge to a CLN node with fine-grained permissions, SSE and spark-wallet support that can be used to develop apps.

## REST

> ðŸ“˜ Pro-tip
> 
> Official support for REST APIs in Core Lightning has been released in v23.08!
>
> C-lightning-REST is scheduled to sunset soon!

[C-lightning-REST](https://github.com/Ride-The-Lightning/c-lightning-REST) is a _third party_ REST API interface for Core Lightning written in Node.js.

For new application development, utilize Core Lightning's first class REST plugin **[clnrest](doc:rest)**.
