|-----------|-------|------------------|----------------|-------------|

Inevitably there are features which need to change: either to be generalized, or removed when they can no longer be supported.

Types of deprecation:
* Command: an entire command is removed.  Usually replaced by a more generic or better-named one.
* Config: a commandline/configuration option is removed.  Usually made the default, or replaced by generalized or better-named.
* Field(s): a JSON field output.  We cannot detect if you are using these, of course.
* Parameter(s): a JSON RPC input.
* Getmanifest Reply: a field in the JSON reply which plugins give to `getmanifest`.
* Hook Return: a field/value in the JSON reply which plugins give to a plugin hook.
* Notification Field: a field in the JSON notification to a plugin.

For each deprecation:
1. The deprecation is listed here, and in the CHANGELOG.md file.
2. We try to give at least 2 versions before removal.
3. Then one version where we issue a warning message if we detect a deprecated feature being used (not possible for deprecatred `Field` types).
4. At least one version where the deprecated feature can be explicit re-enabled using `i-promise-to-fix-broken-api-user=FEATURENAME`.


This is designed to minimize the chance that anyone will be surprised by a change!

You can also test earlier.  Deprecated features can be disabled in three ways:
1. `developer` mode changes the default deprecations to disabled globally.
2. `allow-deprecated-apis=` lets you disable (`false`) or re-enable (`true`) globally.
3. The `deprecations` JSON API can disable/re-enable deprecations for a specific client (added in *v24.02*).
