.SH "NAME"
lightning-invoice \- Command for accepting payments\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBinvoice\fR \fImsatoshi\fR \fIlabel\fR \fIdescription\fR [\fIexpiry\fR] [\fIfallbacks\fR] [\fIpreimage\fR] [\fIexposeprivatechannels\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fBinvoice\fR RPC command creates the expectation of a payment of a given amount of milli\-satoshi: it returns a unique token which another lightning daemon can use to pay this invoice\&. This token includes a \fIroute hint\fR description of an incoming channel with capacity to pay the invoice, if any exists\&.
.sp
The \fImsatoshi\fR parameter can be the string "any", which creates an invoice that can be paid with any amount\&. Otherwise it is in millisatoshi precision; it can be a whole number, or a whole number ending in \fImsat\fR or \fIsat\fR, or a number with three decimal places ending in \fIsat\fR, or a number with 1 to 11 decimal places ending in \fIbtc\fR\&.
.sp
The \fIlabel\fR must be a unique string or number (which is treated as a string, so "01" is different from "1"); it is never revealed to other nodes on the lightning network, but it can be used to query the status of this invoice\&.
.sp
The \fIdescription\fR is a short description of purpose of payment, e\&.g\&. \fI1 cup of coffee\fR\&. This value is encoded into the BOLT11 invoice and is viewable by any node you send this invoice to\&. It must be UTF\-8, and cannot use \fI\eu\fR JSON escape codes\&.
.sp
The \fIexpiry\fR is optionally the number of seconds the invoice is valid for\&. If no value is provided the default of 3600 (1 Hour) is used\&.
.sp
The \fIfallbacks\fR array is one or more fallback addresses to include in the invoice (in order from most\-preferred to least): note that these arrays are not currently tracked to fulfill the invoice\&.
.sp
The \fIpreimage\fR is a 64\-digit hex string to be used as payment preimage for the created invoice\&. By default, if unspecified, lightningd will generate a secure pseudorandom preimage seeded from an appropriate entropy source on your system\&. \fBIMPORTANT\fR: if you specify the \fIpreimage\fR, you are responsible, to ensure appropriate care for generating using a secure pseudorandom generator seeded with sufficient entropy, and keeping the preimage secret\&. This parameter is an advanced feature intended for use with cutting\-edge cryptographic protocols and should not be used unless explicitly needed\&.
.sp
If specified, \fIexposeprivatechannels\fR overrides the default route hint logic, which will use unpublished channels only if there are no published channels\&. If \fItrue\fR unpublished channels are always considered as a route hint candidate; if \fIfalse\fR, never\&.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.sp
On success, a hash is returned as \fIpayment_hash\fR to be given to the payer, and the \fIexpiry_time\fR as a UNIX timestamp\&. It also returns a BOLT11 invoice as \fIbolt11\fR to be given to the payer\&.
.sp
On failure, an error is returned and no invoice is created\&. If the lightning process fails before responding, the caller should use lightning\-listinvoice(7) to query whether this invoice was created or not\&.
.sp
The following error codes may occur:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.ie n \{\
