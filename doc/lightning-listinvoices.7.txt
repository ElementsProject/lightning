LIGHTNING-LISTINVOICES(7)
=========================
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
lightning-listinvoices - Command for querying invoice status

SYNOPSIS
--------
*listinvoices* ['label']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *listinvoices* RPC command gets the status of a specific invoice, if
it exists, or the status of all invoices if given no argument.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, an array 'invoices' of objects is returned.  Each object contains
'label', 'payment_hash', 'status' (one of 'unpaid', 'paid' or 'expired'), and
'expiry_time' (a UNIX timestamp).  If the 'msatoshi' argument to 
lightning-invoice(7) was not "any", there will be an 'msatoshi' field. If the
invoice 'status' is 'paid', there will be a 'pay_index' field and an 
'msatoshi_received' field (which may be slightly greater than 'msatoshi' as
some overpaying is permitted to allow clients to obscure payment paths).
