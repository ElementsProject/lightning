LIGHTNING-DISCONNECT(7)
=======================
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
lightning-disconnect - Command for disconnecting from another lightning node.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*disconnect* 'id'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The disconnect RPC command closes an existing connection to a
peer, identified by 'id', in the Lightning Network, as long as it
doesn't have an active channel.

The 'id' can be discovered in the output of the listpeers
command, which returns a set of peers:

            {
                 "peers": [
                      {
                           "id": "0563aea81...",
                           "connected": true,
                           ...
                      }
                 ]
            }

Passing the 'id' attribute of a peer to 'disconnect' will terminate
the connection.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, an empty object is returned.

ERRORS
------
If 'id' is invalid, an error message will be returned:

     { "code" : -1, "message" : "Peer not connected" }
