NAME

lightning-autocleaninvoice - Set up auto-delete of expired invoice

SYNOPSIS
--------
*autocleaninvoice* ['cycle_seconds'] ['expired_by']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *autocleaninvoice* RPC command sets up automatic cleaning of
expired invoices.

Autoclean will be done every 'cycle_seconds' seconds.
Setting 'cycle_seconds' to 0 disables autoclean.
If not specified, this defaults to 3600 (one hour).

Every autoclean cycle, expired invoices, which have already
been expired for at least 'expired_by' seconds, will be deleted.
If 'expired_by' is not specified, this defaults to 86400 (one day).

On startup of the daemon, no autoclean is set up.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, an empty object is returned.
