.SH NAME
lightning-createinvoice - Low-level invoice creation
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBcreateinvoice\fR \fIinvstring\fR \fIlabel\fR \fIpreimage\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBcreateinvoice\fR RPC command signs and saves an invoice into the
database\.


The \fIinvstring\fR parameter is of bolt11 form, but without the final
signature appended\.  Minimal sanity checks are done\.  (Note: if
\fBexperimental-offers\fR is enabled, \fIinvstring\fR can actually be an
unsigned bolt12 invoice)\.


The \fIlabel\fR must be a unique string or number (which is treated as a
string, so "01" is different from "1"); it is never revealed to other
nodes on the lightning network, but it can be used to query the status
of this invoice\.


The \fIpreimage\fR is the preimage to supply upon successful payment of
the invoice\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success, an invoice object is returned, as per \fBlistinvoices\fR(7)\.


On failure, an error is returned and no invoice is created\. If the
lightning process fails before responding, the caller should use
\fBlightning-listinvoices\fR(7) to query whether this invoice was created or
not\.


The following error codes may occur:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
-1: Catchall nonspecific error\.
.IP \[bu]
900: An invoice with the given \fIlabel\fR already exists\.
