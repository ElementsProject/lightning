.SH NAME
lightning-waitanyinvoice - Command for waiting for payments
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBwaitanyinvoice\fR [\fIlastpay_index\fR] [\fIimmediate\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBwaitanyinvoice\fR RPC command waits until an invoice is paid, then
returns a single entry as per \fBlistinvoice\fR\. It will not return for
any invoices paid prior to or including the \fIlastpay_index\fR\.


This is usually called iteratively: once with no arguments, then
repeatedly with the returned \fIpay_index\fR entry\. This ensures that no
paid invoice is missed\.


The \fIpay_index\fR is a monotonically-increasing number assigned to an
invoice when it gets paid\. The first valid \fIpay_index\fR is 1; specifying
\fIlastpay_index\fR of 0 equivalent to not specifying a \fIlastpay_index\fR\.
Negative \fIlastpay_index\fR is invalid\.


If \fIimmediate\fR is \fItrue\fR, then if no paid invoice is available as
yet, this will return immediately with an error instead of waiting\.
If not specified, or \fIfalse\fR, then this will wait for a paid invoice\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success, an invoice description will be returned as per
\fBlightning-listinvoice\fR(7): \fIcomplete\fR will always be \fItrue\fR\.


Possible errors are:

.IP \[bu]

The \fIimmediate\fR flag was set to \fItrue\fR and no paid invoices
are available right now\.
