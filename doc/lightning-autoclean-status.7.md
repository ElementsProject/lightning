lightning-autoclean-status -- Examine auto-delete of old invoices/payments/forwards
===================================================================================

SYNOPSIS
--------

**autoclean-status** [*subsystem*]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The **autoclean-status** RPC command tells you about the status of
the autclean plugin, optionally for only one subsystem.

The subsystems currently supported are:

* `failedforwards`: routed payments which did not succeed (`failed` or `local_failed` in listforwards `status`).
* `succeededforwards`: routed payments which succeeded (`settled` in listforwards `status`).
* `failedpays`: payment attempts which did not succeed (`failed` in listpays `status`).
* `succededpays`: payment attempts which succeeded (`complete` in listpays `status`).
* `expiredinvoices`: invoices which were not paid (and cannot be) (`expired` in listinvoices `status`).
* `paidinvoices`: invoices which were paid (`paid` in listinvoices `status).

RETURN VALUE
------------

Note that the ages parameters are set by various `autoclean-...-age`
parameters in your configuration: see lightningd-config(5).
