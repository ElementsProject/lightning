lightning-openchannel\_update -- Command to update a collab channel open
========================================================================

SYNOPSIS
--------

**openchannel_update** *channel_id* *psbt*

DESCRIPTION
-----------

`openchannel_update` is a low level RPC command which continues an open
channel, as specified by *channel_id*. An updated  *psbt* is passed in; any
changes from the PSBT last returned (either from `openchannel_init` or
a previous call to `openchannel_update`) will be communicated to the peer.

Must be called after `openchannel_init` and before `openchannel_signed`.

Must be called until *commitments_secured* is returned as true, at which point
`openchannel_signed` should be called with a signed version of the PSBT
returned by the last call to `openchannel_update`.

*channel_id* is the id of the channel.

*psbt* is the updated PSBT to be sent to the peer. May be identical to
the PSBT last returned by either `openchannel_init` or `openchannel_update`.

RETURN VALUE
------------

On success, returns the *channel_id* for this channel; an updated, potentially
complete *psbt* for this channel's funding transaction; and the flag
*commitments_secured*, which indicates the completeness of the returned *psbt*.
If *commitments_secured* is true, caller should proceed with signing the
returned PSBT and calling `openchannel_signed` to complete the channel open.

If *commitments_secured* is true, will also return:
- The derived *channel_id*.
- A *close_to* script, iff a `close_to` address was provided to
  `openchannel_init` and the peer supports `option_upfront_shutdownscript`.
- The *funding_outnum*, the index of the funding output for this channel
  in the funding transaction.
