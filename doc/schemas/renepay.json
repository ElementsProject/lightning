This knowledge is kept through different payment requests, but decays with time to account for the dynamics of the Network (after 1 hour all previous knowledge will be erased). Knowledge from previous payment attempts increases the reliability for subsequent ones.",
    "",
    "Higher probabilities of success and lower fees cannot generally by optimized at once. Hence **renepay** combines the two in different amounts seeking solutions that satisfy *maxfee* bound and a target for 90% probability of success. *maxfee* is a hard bound, in the sense that the command will never attempt a payment when the fees exceed that value. While the probability target is not compulsory (but desirable), i.e. if the best route does not satisfy the 90% probability target it will be tried anyways.",

  "randomization": [
    "To protect user privacy, the payment algorithm performs *shadow route* randomization. Which means the payment algorithm will virtually extend the route by adding delays and fees along it, making it appear to intermediate nodes that the route is longer than it actually is. This prevents intermediate nodes from reliably guessing their distance from the payee.",
