Otherwise it can be a positive value in millisatoshi precision; it can be a whole number, or a whole number ending in msat or sat, or a number with three decimal places ending in sat, or a number with 1 to 11 decimal places ending in btc. `amount` can also have an ISO 4217 postfix (i.e. USD), in which case currency conversion will need to be done for the invoice itself. A plugin is needed which provides the \"currencyconvert\" API for this currency, otherwise the offer creation will fail."
