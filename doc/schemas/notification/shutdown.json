    "Sent in two situations: lightningd is (almost completely) shutdown, or the plugin stop command has been called for this plugin. In both cases the plugin has 30 seconds to exit itself, otherwise it's killed. In the shutdown case, plugins should not interact with lightningd except via (id-less) logging or notifications. New rpc calls will fail with error code -5 and (plugin's) responses will be ignored. Because lightningd can crash or be killed, a plugin cannot rely on the shutdown notification always being sent."
