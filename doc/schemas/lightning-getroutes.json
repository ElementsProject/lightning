    "There are two automatic layers: *auto.localchans* contains information on local channels from this node (including non-public ones), and their exact current spendable capacities, and *auto.sourcefree* overrides all channels leading out of the *source* to be zero fee and zero delay.  These are both useful in the case where the source is the current node."
