For a method to send arbitrary messages over multiple hops, including hops that do not understand the custom message, see the `createonion` and `sendonion` RPC methods. Messages can only be injected if the connection is handled by `openingd` or `channeld`. Messages cannot be injected when the peer is handled by `onchaind` or `closingd` since these do not have a connection, or are synchronous daemons that do not handle spontaneous messages."

We do (as of *v23.11*) allow sending of even types, but note that peers (as per the spec) will disconnect on receiving unknown even types."
