For a method to send arbitrary messages over multiple hops, including hops that do not understand the custom message, see the `createonion` and `sendonion` RPC methods. Messages can only be injected if the connection is handled by `openingd` or `channeld`. Messages cannot be injected when the peer is handled by `onchaind` or `closingd` since these do not have a connection, or are synchronous daemons that do not handle spontaneous messages."

The message types may not be one of the internally handled types, since that may cause issues with the internal state tracking of Core Lightning. We do (as of *v23.11*) allow sending of even types, but note that peers (as per the spec) will disconnect on receiving unknown even types."
