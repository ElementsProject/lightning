(Note that modern peers use the quick-close protocol which does not allow negotiation: see *feerange* instead)\tOn every negotiation step we must give up some amount from our proposal towards the peer's proposal. This parameter can be an integer in which case it is interpreted as number of satoshis to step at a time. Or it can be an integer followed by `%` to designate a percentage of the interval to give up. A few examples, assuming the peer proposes a closing fee of 3000 satoshi and our estimate shows it must be 4000:\t- `10`: our next proposal will be 4000-10=3990.\t- `10%`: our next proposal will be 4000-(10% of (4000-3000))=3900.\t- '1': our next proposal will be 3999. This is the most extreme case when we insist on our fee as much as possible.\t- `100%`: our next proposal will be 3000. This is the most relaxed case when we quickly accept the peer's proposal.\tThe default is `50%`"
