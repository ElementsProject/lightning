Knowledge from previous payment attempts increases the reliability for subsequent ones.",
    "",
    "Higher probabilities of success and lower fees cannot generally by optimized at once. Hence **renepay** combines the two in different amounts seeking solutions that satisfy *maxfee* bound and a target for 90% probability of success. *maxfee* is a hard bound, in the sense that the command will never attempt a payment when the fees exceed that value. While the probability target is not compulsory (but desirable), i.e. if the best route does not satisfy the 90% probability target it will be tried anyways.",

  "randomization": [
    "To protect user privacy, the payment algorithm performs *shadow route* randomization.
