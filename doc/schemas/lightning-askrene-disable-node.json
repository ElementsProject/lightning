    "The **askrene-disable-node** RPC command tells askrene to disable all channels connected to a node whenever the given layer is used.  This is mainly useful to force the use of alternate paths: while individual channels can be disabled using askrene-create-channel or askrene-inform-channel, that would be racy if new channels appeared."
