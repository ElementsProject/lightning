LIGHTNING-WAITANYINVOICE(7)
===========================
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
lightning-waitanyinvoice - Command for waiting for payments.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*waitanyinvoice* ['lastpay_index']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *waitanyinvoice* RPC command waits until an invoice is paid, then
returns a single entry as per *listinvoice*.  It will not return for
any invoices paid prior to or including the 'lastpay_index'.

This is usually called iteratively: once with no arguments, then
repeatedly with the returned 'pay_index' entry.  This ensures that no paid
invoice is missed.

The 'pay_index' is a monotonically-increasing number assigned to an
invoice when it gets paid. The first valid 'pay_index' is 1; specifying
'lastpay_index' of 0 equivalent to not specifying a 'lastpay_index'.
Negative 'lastpay_index' is invalid.


RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, an invoice description will be returned as per lightning-listinvoice(7): 'complete' will always be 'true'.
