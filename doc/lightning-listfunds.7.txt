NAME
----
lightning-listfunds - Command showing all funds currently managed by 
the c-lightning node.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*listfunds* 

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *listfunds* RPC command displays all funds available, either in 
unspent outputs (UTXOs) in the internal wallet or funds locked in 
currently open channels.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success two arrays will be returned: 'outputs' with funds 
currently locked onchain in UTXOs and 'channels' with funds 
readily spendable in channels. 

Each entry in 'outputs' will include:

- 'txid'

- 'address'

- 'output'

- 'value'

- 'amount_sat' (the same as 'value' with 'sat' appended)

- 'status'

Each entry in 'channels' will include: 

- 'peer_id' - the peer with which the channel is opened.

- 'short_channel_id' - as per BOLT 7 (representing the block, transaction
number and output index of the channel funding transaction).

- 'channel_sat' - available satoshis on our node's end of the channel 
(values rounded down to satoshis as internal storage is in millisatoshi).

- 'our_amount_sat' - same as above, but with 'sat' appended.

- 'channel_total_sat' - total channel value in satoshi 

- 'amount_sat' - same as above, but with 'sat' appended.

- 'funding_txid' - funding transaction id.
