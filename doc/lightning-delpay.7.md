--------

- **completed\_at** (u64, optional): the UNIX timestamp showing when this payment was completed
- **groupid** (u64, optional): Grouping key to disambiguate multiple attempts to pay an invoice or the same payment\_hash

ERRORS
------

On failure, an error is returned. If the lightning process fails before responding, the
caller should use lightning-listsentpays(7) or lightning-listpays(7) to query whether this payment was deleted or not.

The following error codes may occur:

- -32602: Parameter missed or malformed;
- 211: Payment status mismatch. Check the correct status via **paystatus**;
- 208: Payment with payment\_hash not found.
