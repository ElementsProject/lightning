lightning-decode -- Command for decoding an invoice string (low-level)
=======================================================================

SYNOPSIS
--------

**(WARNING: experimental-offers only)**

**decode** *string*

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The **decode** RPC command checks and parses a *bolt11* or *bolt12*
string (optionally prefixed by `lightning:` or `LIGHTNING:`) as
specified by the BOLT 11 and BOLT 12 specifications.  It may decode
other formats in future.

RETURN VALUE
------------
