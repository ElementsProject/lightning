lightning-decode -- Command for decoding an invoice string (low-level)
=======================================================================

SYNOPSIS
--------

**decode** *string*

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The **decode** RPC command checks and parses:

- a *bolt11* or *bolt12* string (optionally prefixed by `lightning:`
  or `LIGHTNING:`) as specified by the BOLT 11 and BOLT 12
  specifications.
- a *rune* as created by lightning-commando-rune(7).
- an *emergency\_recover* string generated by hsmtool like
 `lightning-hsmtool getemergencyrecover <path/to/emergency.recover>`.
  It holds `emergency.recover` contents and starts with `clnemerg1`.

It may decode other formats in future.

RETURN VALUE
------------
