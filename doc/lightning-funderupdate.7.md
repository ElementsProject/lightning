DESCRIPTION
-----------

For channel open requests using


*policy*, *policy_mod* is the policy the funder plugin will use to decide
how much capital to commit to a v2 open channel request. There are three
policy options, detailed below: `match`, `available`, and `fixed`.
The *policy_mod* is the number or 'modification' to apply to the policy.
Default is (fixed, 0sats).

* `match` -- Contribute *policy_mod* percent of their requested funds.
   Valid *policy_mod* values are 0 to 200. If this is a channel lease
   request, we match based on their requested funds. If it is not a
   channel lease request (and *lease_only* is false), then we match
   their funding amount. Note: any lease match less than 100 will
   likely fail, as clients will not accept a lease less than their request.
* `available` -- Contribute *policy_mod* percent of our available
   node wallet funds. Valid *policy_mod* values are 0 to 100.
* `fixed` -- Contributes a fixed  *policy_mod* sats to v2 channel open requests.

Note: to maximize channel leases, best policy setting is (match, 100).

*leases_only* will only contribute funds to `option_will_fund` requests
which pay to lease funds. Defaults to false, will fund any v2 open request
using *policy* even if it's they're not seeking to lease funds. Note that
`option_will_fund` commits funds for 4032 blocks (~1mo). Must also set
*lease_fee_base_msat*, *lease_fee_basis*, *funding_weight*,
*channel_fee_max_base_msat*, and *channel_fee_max_proportional_thousandths*
to advertise available channel leases.

*min_their_funding_msat* is the minimum funding sats that we require in order
to activate our contribution policy to the v2 open.  Defaults to 10k sats.

*max_their_funding_msat* is the maximum funding sats that we will consider
to activate our contribution policy to the v2 open. Any channel open above this
will not be funded.  Defaults to no max (`UINT_MAX`).

*per_channel_min_msat* is the minimum amount that we will contribute to a
channel open. Defaults to 10k sats.

*per_channel_max_msat* is the maximum amount that we will contribute to a
channel open. Defaults to no max (`UINT_MAX`).

*reserve_tank_msat* is the amount of sats to leave available in the node wallet.
Defaults to zero sats.

*fuzz_percent* is a percentage to fuzz the resulting contribution amount by.
Valid values are 0 to 100. Note that turning this on with (match, 100) policy
will randomly fail `option_will_fund` leases, as most clients
expect an exact or greater match of their `requested_funds`.
Defaults to 0% (no fuzz).

*fund_probability* is the percent of v2 channel open requests to apply our
policy to. Valid values are integers from 0 (fund 0% of all open requests)
to 100 (fund every request). Useful for randomizing opens that receive funds.
Defaults to 100.

Setting any of the next 5 options will activate channel leases for this node,
and advertise these values via the lightning gossip network. If any one is set,
the other values will be the default.

*lease_fee_base_msat* is the flat fee for a channel lease. Node will
receive this much extra added to their channel balance, paid by the opening
node. Defaults to 2k sats. Note that the minimum is 1sat.

*lease_fee_basis* is a basis fee that's calculated as 1/10k of the total
requested funds the peer is asking for. Node will receive the total of
*lease_fee_basis* times requested funds / 10k satoshis added to their channel
balance, paid by the opening node.  Default is 0.65% (65 basis points)

*funding_weight* is used to calculate the fee the peer will compensate your
node for its contributing inputs to the funding transaction. The total fee
is calculated as the `open_channel2`.`funding_feerate_perkw` times this
*funding_weight* divided by 1000. Node will have this funding fee added
to their channel balance, paid by the opening node.  Default is
2 inputs + 1 P2WPKH output.

*channel_fee_max_base_msat* is a commitment to a maximum
`channel_fee_base_msat` that your node will charge for routing payments
over this leased channel during the lease duration.  Default is 5k sats.

*channel_fee_max_proportional_thousandths* is a commitment to a maximum
`channel_fee_proportional_millionths` that your node will charge for
routing payments over this leased channel during the lease duration.
Note that it's denominated in 'thousandths'. A setting of `1` is equal
to 1k ppm; `5` is 5k ppm, etc.  Default is 100 (100k ppm).

*compact_lease* is a compact description of the channel lease params. When
opening a channel, passed in to `fundchannel` to indicate the terms we
expect from the peer.

RETURN VALUE

On success, an object is returned, containing:
- **summary** (string): Summary of the current funding policy e.g. (match 100)
- **policy** (string): Policy funder plugin will use to decide how much captial to commit to a v2 open channel request (one of "match", "available", "fixed")
- **policy_mod** (u32): The *policy_mod* is the number or 'modification' to apply to the policy.
- **leases_only** (boolean): Only contribute funds to `option_will_fund` lease requests.
- **min_their_funding_msat** (msat): The minimum funding sats that we require from peer to activate our funding policy.
- **max_their_funding_msat** (msat): The maximum funding sats that we'll allow from peer to activate our funding policy.
- **per_channel_min_msat** (msat): The minimum amount that we will fund a channel open with.
