.SH "NAME"
lightning-getroute \- Command for routing a payment (low\-level)\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBgetroute\fR \fIid\fR \fImsatoshi\fR \fIriskfactor\fR [\fIcltv\fR] [\fIfromid\fR] [\fIfuzzpercent\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fBgetroute\fR RPC command attempts to find the best route for the payment of \fImsatoshi\fR to lightning node \fIid\fR, such that the payment will arrive at \fIid\fR with \fIcltv\fR\-blocks to spare (default 9)\&.
.sp
There are two considerations for how good a route is: how low the fees are, and how long your payment will get stuck if a node goes down during the process\&. The \fIriskfactor\fR floating\-point field controls this tradeoff; it is the annual cost of your funds being stuck (as a percentage)\&.
.sp
For example, if you thought the inconvenience of having funds stuck was worth 20% per annum interest, \fIriskfactor\fR would be 20\&.
.sp
If you didn\(cqt care about risk, \fIriskfactor\fR would be zero\&.
.sp
\fIfromid\fR is the node to start the route from: default is this node\&.
.sp
The \fIfuzzpercent\fR is a positive floating\-point number, representing a percentage of the actual fee\&. The \fIfuzzpercent\fR is used to distort computed fees along each channel, to provide some randomization to the route generated\&. 0\&.0 means the exact fee of that channel is used, while 100\&.0 means the fee used might be from 0 to twice the actual fee\&. The default is 5\&.0, or up to 5% fee distortion\&.
.SH "RISKFACTOR EFFECT ON ROUTING"
.sp
The risk factor is treated as if it were an additional fee on the route, for the purposes of comparing routes\&.
.sp
The formula used is the following approximation:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
risk\-fee = amount x blocks\-timeout x per\-block\-cost
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
We are given a \fIriskfactor\fR expressed as a percentage\&. There are 52596 blocks per year, thus \fIper\-block\-cost\fR is \fIriskfactor\fR divided by 5,259,600\&.
.sp
The final result is:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
risk\-fee = amount x blocks\-timeout x riskfactor / 5259600
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Here are the risk fees in millisatoshis, using various parameters\&. I assume a channel charges the default of 1000 millisatoshis plus 1 part\-per\-million\&. Common delay values on the network at 14 and 144\&.

.sp 1
.SH "RECOMMENDED RISKFACTOR VALUES"
.sp
The default \fIfuzz\fR factor is 5%, so as you can see from the table above, that tends to overwhelm the effect of \fIriskfactor\fR less than about 5\&.
.sp
1 is a conservative value for a stable lightning network with very few failures\&.
.sp
1000 is an aggressive value for trying to minimize timeouts at all costs\&.
.sp
The default for lightning\-pay(7) is 10, which starts to become a major factor for larger amounts, and is basically ignored for tiny ones\&.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.sp
On success, a "route" array is returned\&. Each array element contains \fIid\fR (the node being routed through), \fImsatoshi\fR (the millisatoshis sent), and \fIdelay\fR (the number of blocks to timeout at this node)\&.
.sp
The final \fIid\fR will be the destination \fIid\fR given in the input\&. The difference between the first \fImsatoshi\fR minus the \fImsatoshi\fR given in the input is the fee\&. The first \fIdelay\fR is the very worst case timeout for the payment failure, in blocks\&.
