.SH NAME
lightning-delinvoice - Command for removing an invoice
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBdelinvoice\fR \fIlabel\fR \fIstatus\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBdelinvoice\fR RPC command removes an invoice with \fIstatus\fR as given
in \fBlistinvoices\fR\.


The caller should be particularly aware of the error case caused by the
\fIstatus\fR changing just before this command is invoked!

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success, an invoice description will be returned as per
\fBlightning-listinvoice\fR(7)\.

.SH ERRORS

The following errors may be reported:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
-1:  Database error\.
.IP \[bu]
905:  An invoice with that label does not exist\.
.IP \[bu]
906:  The invoice \fIstatus\fR does not match the parameter\.
An error object will be returned as error \fIdata\fR, containing
\fIcurrent_status\fR and \fIexpected_status\fR fields\.
This is most likely due to the \fIstatus\fR of the invoice
changing just before this command is invoked\.
