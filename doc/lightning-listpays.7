.SH NAME
lightning-listpays - Command for querying payment status
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBlistpays\fR [bolt11]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBlistpay\fR RPC command gets the status of all \fIpay\fR commands, or a
single one if \fIbolt11\fR is specified\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success, an array of objects is returned\. Each object contains:


 \fIbolt11\fR
the \fIbolt11\fR argument given to \fIpay\fR (see below for exceptions)\.


 \fIstatus\fR
one of \fIcomplete\fR, \fIfailed\fR or \fIpending\fR\.


 \fIpayment_preimage\fR
(if \fIstatus\fR is \fIcomplete\fR) proves payment was received\.


 \fIlabel\fR
optional \fIlabel\fR, if provided to \fIpay\fR\.


 \fIamount_sent_msat\fR
total amount sent, in "NNNmsat" format\.


For old payments (pre-0\.7) we didn’t save the \fIbolt11\fR string, so in its
place are three other fields:


 \fIpayment_hash\fR
the hash of the \fIpayment_preimage\fR which will prove payment\.


 \fIdestination\fR
the final destination of the payment\.


 \fIamount_msat\fR
the amount the destination received, in "NNNmsat" format\.


These three can all be extracted from \fIbolt11\fR, hence are obsolete\.
