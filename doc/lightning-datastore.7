.SH NAME
lightning-datastore - Command for storing (plugin) data
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBdatastore\fR \fIkey\fR [\fIstring\fR|\fIhex\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBdatastore\fR RPC command allows plugins to store data in the
c-lightning database, for later retrieval\.


There can only be one entry for each \fIkey\fR, so prefixing with the
plugin name (e\.g\. \fBsummary.\fR) is recommended\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

.RS
.IP \[bu]
\fBkey\fR (string): The key which has been added to the datastore
.IP \[bu]
\fBhex\fR (hex): The hex data which has been added to the datastore
.IP \[bu]
\fBstring\fR (string, optional): The data as a string, if it's valid utf-8

.RE

The main cause of failure is an already-existing entry\.


The following error codes may occur:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
-32602: invalid parameters, including already-existing key\.
