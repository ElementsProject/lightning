.SH NAME
lightning-datastore - Command for storing (plugin) data
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBdatastore\fR \fIkey\fR [\fIstring\fR] [\fIhex\fR] [\fImode\fR] [\fIgeneration\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBdatastore\fR RPC command allows plugins to store data in the
c-lightning database, for later retrieval\.


There can only be one entry for each \fIkey\fR, so prefixing with the
plugin name (e\.g\. \fBsummary.\fR) is recommended\.


\fImode\fR is one of "must-create" (default, fails it it already exists),
"must-replace" (fails it it doesn't already exist),
"create-or-replace" (never fails), "must-append" (must already exist,
append this to what's already there) or "create-or-append" (append if
anything is there, otherwise create)\.


\fIgeneration\fR, if specified, means that the update will fail if the
previously-existing data is not exactly that generation\.  This allows
for simple atomicity\.  This is only legal with \fImode\fR "must-replace"
or "must-append"\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success, an object is returned, containing:
