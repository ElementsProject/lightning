.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBopenchannel_update\fR \fIchannel_id\fR \fIpsbt\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBopenchannel_update\fR is a low level RPC command which continues an open
channel, as specified by \fIchannel_id\fR\. An updated  \fIpsbt\fR is passed in; any
changes from the PSBT last returned (either from \fBopenchannel_init\fR or
a previous call to \fBopenchannel_update\fR) will be communicated to the peer\.


Must be called after \fBopenchannel_init\fR and before \fBopenchannel_signed\fR\.


Must be called until \fIcommitments_secured\fR is returned as true, at which point
\fBopenchannel_signed\fR should be called with a signed version of the PSBT
returned by the last call to \fBopenchannel_update\fR\.


\fIchannel_id\fR is the id of the channel\.


\fIpsbt\fR is the updated PSBT to be sent to the peer\. May be identical to
the PSBT last returned by either \fBopenchannel_init\fR or \fBopenchannel_update\fR\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success, returns the \fIchannel_id\fR for this channel; an updated, potentially
complete \fIpsbt\fR for this channel's funding transaction; and the flag
\fIcommitments_secured\fR, which indicates the completeness of the returned \fIpsbt\fR\.
If \fIcommitments_secured\fR is true, caller should proceed with signing the
returned PSBT and calling \fBopenchannel_signed\fR to complete the channel open\.
