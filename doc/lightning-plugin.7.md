lightning-plugin -- Manage plugins with RPC
===========================================

SYNOPSIS
--------

**plugin** command [*parameter*] [*second\_parameter*]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The **plugin** RPC command allows to manage plugins without having to
restart lightningd. It takes 1 to 3 parameters: a command
(start/stop/startdir/rescan/list) which describes the action to take and
optionally one or two parameters which describes the plugin on which the
action has to be taken.

The *start* command takes a path as the first parameter and will load
the plugin available from this path. The path can be a full path to a
plugin or a relative path to a plugin that is located in or below the
default plugins directory. Any additional parameters are passed to the
plugin. It will wait for the plugin to complete the handshake with
`lightningd` for 20 seconds at the most.

The *stop* command takes a plugin name as parameter. It will kill and
unload the specified plugin.

The *startdir* command takes a directory path as first parameter and will
load all plugins this directory contains. It will wait for each plugin to
complete the handshake with `lightningd` for 20 seconds at the most.

The *rescan* command starts all not-already-loaded plugins from the
default plugins directory (by default *~/.lightning/plugins*).

The *list* command will return all the active plugins.

RETURN VALUE
------------

[comment]: # (GENERATE-FROM-SCHEMA-START)
On success, an object is returned, containing:
- **command** (string): the subcommand this is responding to (one of "start", "stop", "rescan", "startdir", "list")

If **command** is "start", "startdir", "rescan" or "list":
  - **plugins** (array of objects):
    - **name** (string): full pathname of the plugin
    - **active** (boolean): status; since plugins are configured asynchronously, a freshly started plugin may not appear immediately.

If **command** is "stop":
  - **result** (string): A message saying it successfully stopped

[comment]: # (GENERATE-FROM-SCHEMA-END)

On error, the reason why the action could not be taken upon the
plugin is returned.
