/* # Optimal payments
 *
 * In this module we reduce the routing optimization problem to a linear
 * cost optimization problem and find a solution using MCF algorithms.
 * The optimization of the routing itself doesn't need a precise numerical
 * solution, since we can be happy near optimal results; e.g. paying 100 msat or
 * 101 msat for fees doesn't make any difference if we wish to deliver 1M sats.
 * On the other hand, we are now also considering Pickhard's
 * [1] model to improve payment reliability,
 * hence our optimization moves to a 2D space: either we like to maximize the
 * probability of success of a payment or minimize the routing fees, or
 * alternatively we construct a function of the two that gives a good compromise.
 *
 * Therefore from now own, the definition of optimal is a matter of choice.
 * To simplify the API of this module, we think the best way to state the
 * problem is:
 *
 * 	Find a routing solution that pays the least of fees while keeping
 * 	the probability of success above a certain value `min_probability`.
 *
 *
 * # Fee Cost
 *
 * Routing fees is non-linear function of the payment flow x, that's true even
 * without the base fee:
 *
 * 	fee_msat = base_msat + floor(millionths*x_msat / 10^6)
 *
 * We approximate this fee into a linear function by computing a slope `c_fee` such
 * that:
 *
 * 	fee_microsat = c_fee * x_sat
 *
 * Function `linear_fee_cost` computes `c_fee` based on the base and
 * proportional fees of a channel.
 * The final product if microsat because if only
 * the proportional fee was considered we can have c_fee = millionths.
 * Moving to costs based in msats means we have to either truncate payments
 * below 1ksats or estimate as 0 cost for channels with less than 1000ppm.
 *
 * TODO(eduardo): shall we build a linear cost function in msats?
 *
 * # Probability cost
 *
 * The probability of success P of the payment is the product of the prob. of
 * success of forwarding parts of the payment over all routing channels. This
 * problem is separable if we log it, and since we would like to increase P,
 * then we can seek to minimize -log(P), and that's our prob. cost function [1].
 *
 * 	- log P = sum_{i} - log P_i
 *
 * The probability of success `P_i` of sending some flow `x` on a channel with
 * liquidity l in the range a<=l<b is
 *
 * 	P_{a,b}(x) = (b-x)/(b-a); for x > a
 * 		   = 1.         ; for x <= a
 *
 * Notice that unlike the similar formula in [1], the one we propose does not
 * contain the quantization shot noise for counting states. The formula remains
 * valid independently of the liquidity units (sats or msats).
 *
 * The cost associated to probability P is then -k log P, where k is some
 * constant. For k=1 we get the following table:
 *
 * 	prob | cost
 * 	-----------
 * 	0.01 | 4.6
 * 	0.02 | 3.9
 * 	0.05 | 3.0
 * 	0.10 | 2.3
 * 	0.20 | 1.6
 * 	0.50 | 0.69
 * 	0.80 | 0.22
 * 	0.90 | 0.10
 * 	0.95 | 0.05
 * 	0.98 | 0.02
 * 	0.99 | 0.01
 *
 * Clearly -log P(x) is non-linear; we try to linearize it piecewise:
 * split the channel into 4 arcs representing 4 liquidity regions:
 *
 * 	arc_0 -> [0, a)
 * 	arc_1 -> [a, a+(b-a)*f1)
 * 	arc_2 -> [a+(b-a)*f1, a+(b-a)*f2)
 * 	arc_3 -> [a+(b-a)*f2, a+(b-a)*f3)
 *
 * where f1 = 0.5, f2 = 0.8, f3 = 0.95;
 * We fill arc_0's capacity with complete certainty P=1, then if more flow is
 * needed we start filling the capacity in arc_1 until the total probability
 * of success reaches P=0.5, then arc_2 until P=1-0.8=0.2, and finally arc_3 until
 * P=1-0.95=0.05. We don't go further than 5% prob. of success per channel.

 * TODO(eduardo): this channel linearization is hard coded into
 * `CHANNEL_PIVOTS`, maybe we can parametrize this to take values from the config file.
 *
 * With this choice, the slope of the linear cost function becomes:
 *
 * 	m_0 = 0
 * 	m_1 = 1.38 k /(b-a)
 * 	m_2 = 3.05 k /(b-a)
 * 	m_3 = 9.24 k /(b-a)
 *
 * Notice that one of the assumptions in [2] for the MCF problem is that flows
 * and the slope of the costs functions are integer numbers. The only way we
 * have at hand to make it so, is to choose a universal value of `k` that scales
 * up the slopes so that floor(m_i) is not zero for every arc.
 *
 * # Combine fee and prob. costs
 *
 * We attempt to solve the original problem of finding the solution that
 * pays the least fees while keeping the prob. of success above a certain value,
 * by constructing a cost function which is a linear combination of fee and
 * prob. costs.
 * TODO(eduardo): investigate how this procedure is justified,
 * possibly with the use of Lagrange optimization theory.
 *
 * At first, prob. and fee costs live in different dimensions, they cannot be
 * summed, it's like comparing apples and oranges.
 * However we propose to scale the prob. cost by a global factor k that
 * translates into the monetization of prob. cost.
 *
 * This was chosen empirically from examination of typical network values.

/* Let's try this encoding of arcs:

 * linearize the cost function, but also to solve MCF
 * problem we need to keep track of flows in the
 * residual network hence we need for each directed arc
 * in the network there must be another arc in the
 * opposite direction refered to as it's dual. In total
 * 1+2+1 additional bits of information:
 *
 * 	(chan_idx)(half)(part)(dual)
 *
 * That means, for each channel we need to store the
 * information of 16 arcs. If we implement a convex-cost
 * solver then we can reduce that number to size(half)size(dual)=4.
 *
 * In the adjacency of a `node` we are going to store
 * the outgoing arcs. If we ever need to loop over the
 * incoming arcs then we will define a reverse adjacency
 * API.
 * Then for each outgoing channel `(c,half)` there will
 * be 4 parts for the actual residual capacity, hence
 * with the dual bit set to 0:
 *
 * 	(c,half,0,0)
 * 	(c,half,1,0)
 * 	(c,half,2,0)
 * 	(c,half,3,0)
 *
 * and also we need to consider the dual arcs
 * corresponding to the channel direction `(c,!half)`
 * (the dual has reverse direction):
 *
 * 	(c,!half,0,1)
 * 	(c,!half,1,1)
 * 	(c,!half,2,1)
 * 	(c,!half,3,1)
 *
 * These are the 8 outgoing arcs relative to `node` and
 * associated with channel `c`. The incoming arcs will
 * be:
 *
 * 	(c,!half,0,0)
 * 	(c,!half,1,0)
 * 	(c,!half,2,0)
 * 	(c,!half,3,0)
 *
 * 	(c,half,0,1)
 * 	(c,half,1,1)
 * 	(c,half,2,1)
 * 	(c,half,3,1)
 *
 * but they will be stored as outgoing arcs on the peer
 * node `next`.
 *
 * I hope this will clarify my future self when I forget.
