/* Let `recv` be the maximum amount this channel can receive, this function

 * From BOLT7 specification wee need to satisfy the following inequality:
 *
 *	recv-send >= base_fee + floor(send*proportional_fee/1000000)
 *
 * That is equivalent to have
 *
 *	send <= Bound(recv,send)
 *
 * where
 *
 *	Bound(recv, send) = ((recv - base_fee)*1000000 + (send*proportional_fee)
 *% 1000000)/(proportional_fee+1000000)
 *
 * However the quantity we want to determine, `send`, appears on both sides of
 * the equation. However the term `send*proportional_fee) % 1000000` only
 * contributes by increasing the bound by at most one so that we can neglect
 * the extra term and use instead
 *
 *	Bound_simple(recv) = ((recv -
 *base_fee)*1000000)/(proportional_fee+1000000)
 *
 * as the upper bound for `send`. Formally one can check that
 *
 *	Bound_simple(recv) <= Bound(recv, send) < Bound_simple(recv) + 2
 *
 * So that if one wishes to find the very highest value of `send` that
 * satisfies
 *
 *	send <= Bound(recv, send)
 *
 * it is enough to compute
 *
 *	send = Bound_simple(recv)
 *
 *  which already satisfies the fee equation and then try to go higher
 *  with send+1, send+2, etc. But we know that it is enough to try up to
 *  send+1 because Bound(recv, send) < Bound_simple(recv) + 2.
