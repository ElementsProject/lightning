 * mu (μ) is used as follows in the cost function:
 *
 *     -log((c_e + 1 - f_e) / (c_e + 1)) + μ fee
 *
 * This raises the question of how to set mu?  The left term is a
 * logrithmic failure probability, the right term is the fee in
 * millisats.
 *
 * We want a more "usable" measure of frugality (fr), where fr = 1
 * means that the two terms are roughly equal, and fr < 1 means the
 * probability is more important, and fr > 1 means the fee is more
 * important.
 *
 * For this we take the current payment amount and the median channel
 * capacity and feerates:
 *
 * -log((median_cap + 1 - f_e) / (median_cap + 1)) = μ (1/fr) median_fee
 *
 * => μ = -log((median_cap + 1 - f_e) / (median_cap + 1)) * fr / median_fee
 *
 * But this is slightly too naive!  If we're trying to make a payment larger
 * than the median, this is undefined; and grows hugely when we're near the median.
 * In fact, it should be "the median of all channels larger than the amount",
 * which is what we calculate here.
 *
 * Turns out that in the real network:
 * - median_cap = 1250800000
 * - median_feerate = 51
 *
 * And the log term at the 10th percentile capacity is about 0.125 of the median,
 * and at the 90th percentile capacity the log term is about 12.5 the value at the median.
 *
 * In other words, we expose a simple frugality knob with reasonable
 * range 0.1 (don't care about fees) to 10 (fees before probability),
 * and generate our μ from there.
