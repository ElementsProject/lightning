// TODO(eduardo): renepaystatus should be similar to paystatus

// routing channels.

// TODO(eduardo): check a problem with param_millionths(), if I input an integer
// should or shouldn't be multiplied by 10^6?
// TODO(eduardo): add an option entry for maxfeepercent
// TODO(eduardo): write a man entry for renepay
// TODO(eduardo): check if paynotes are meaningful
// TODO(eduardo): remove assertions, introduce LOG_BROKEN messages

// TODO(eduardo): Test ideas
// - make a payment to a node that is hidden behind private channels, check that
// private channels are removed from the gossmap and chan_extra_map
// - one payment route hangs, and the rest keep waiting, eventually all MPP
// should timeout and we retry excluding the unresponsive path (are we able to
// identify it?)
// - a particular route fails because fees are wrong, we update the gossip
// information and redo the path.
// - a MPP in which several parts have a common intermediary node
// 	source -MANY- o -MANY- dest
// - a MPP in which several parts have a common intermediary channel
// 	source -MANY- o--o -MANY- dest
// - a payment with a direct channel to the destination
// - payment failures:
// 	- destination is not in the gossmap
// 	- destination is offline
// 	- with current knowledge there is no flow solution to destination
