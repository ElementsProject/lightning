/**
 * optimal_payment_flow - API for min cost flow function(s).
 * @ctx: context to allocate returned flows from
 * @gossmap: the gossip map
 * @source: the source to start from
 * @target: the target to pay
 * @chan_extra_map: hashtable of extra per-channel information
 * @disabled: NULL, or a bitmap by channel index of channels not to use.
 * @amount: the amount we want to reach @target
 *
 * @max_fee: the maximum allowed in fees
 *
 * @min_probability: minimum probability accepted
 *
 * @delay_feefactor converts 1 block delay into msat, as if it were an additional
 * fee.  So if a CLTV delay on a node is 5 blocks, that's treated as if it
 * were a fee of 5 * @delay_feefactor.
 *
 * @base_fee_penalty: factor to compute additional proportional cost from each
 * unit of base fee. So #base_fee_penalty will be added to the effective
 * proportional fee for each msat of base fee.
 *
 * 	effective_ppm = proportional_fee + base_fee_msat * base_fee_penalty
 *
 * @prob_cost_factor: factor used to monetize the probability cost. It is
 * defined as the number of ppm (parts per million of the total payment) we
 * are willing to pay to improve the probability of success by 0.1%.
 *
 * 	k_microsat = floor(1000*prob_cost_factor * payment_sat)
 *
 * this k is used to compute a prob. cost in units of microsats
 *
 * 	cost(payment) = - k_microsat * log Prob(payment)
 *
 * Return a series of subflows which deliver amount to target, or NULL.
