Library Requirements
--------------------

You will need several development libraries:
* libprotoc: the Google protocol buffer v2 library, 2.6.0 or above.
* protobuf-c: version 1.1.0 or above.
* libsqlite3: for database support.
* libgmp: for secp256k1

For actually doing development and running the tests, you will also need:
* pip3: to install python-bitcoinlib
* asciidoc: for formatting the man pages (if you change them)
* valgrind: for extra debugging checks

You will also need a version of bitcoind with segregated witness support,
such as the 0.13 or above.

To Build on Ubuntu 16.04
---------------------

Get dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install -y autoconf libtool libprotobuf-c-dev libsqlite3-dev libgmp-dev libsqlite3-dev
```

For development or running tests, get additional dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install -y asciidoc valgrind python3-pip && pip3 install python-bitcoinlib
```

**Note**: You may need to include `testnet=1` in `bitcoin.conf`

To Build on Ubuntu 15.10
------------------------
Build protobuf-c dependency (>= 1.1.0):
```
sudo apt-get install libprotoc-dev
git clone https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c.git
cd protobuf-c
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install
cd ../
```
