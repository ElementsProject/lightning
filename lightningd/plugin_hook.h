/**
 * Plugin hooks are a way for plugins to implement custom behavior and
 * reactions to certain things in `lightningd`. `lightningd` will ask
 * plugins that have registered a hook for a given event how it'd like
 * to proceed. This allows plugins to deviate from the default
 * behavior that `lightningd` otherwise implements.
 *
 * Examples include storing an additional backup of important
 * information belonging to the wallet before committing to it, or
 * holding an incoming payment that is guaranteed to succeed for some
 * time in order to check that the delivery of goods works correctly,
 * giving the option of instantly refunding should something go wrong.
 *
 * Hooks are commonly structured into a number of converter functions
 * and a callback. The converter functions convert from an internal
 * struct representation of the method arguments to a JSON-object for
 * delivery to the plugin, and from a JSON-object to the internal
 * representation:
 *
 * - `serialize_payload` which takes a payload of type `payload_type`
 *   and serializes it into the given `json_stream`. `
 *
 * - `deserialize_response` takes a `json_stream` and parses it into a
 *   new struct of type `response_type`,
 *
 * - `response_cb` is called once the plugin has responded and the
 *   response has been parsed by `deserialize_response`. In addition
 *   an arrbitrary additional argument of type `cb_arg_type` can be
 *   passed along that may contain any additional context necessary.
 *
 *
 * To make hook invocations easier, each hook registered with
 * `REGISTER_PLUGIN_HOOK` provides a `plugin_hook_call_hookname`
 * function that performs typechecking at compile time, and makes sure
 * that all the provided functions for serialization, deserialization
 * and callback have the correct type.
