# Define some messages that any subdaemon may be sending to the main daemon
# The message types need to be disjoint from any message types defined in the
# per-daemon status files, by convention these are all in the 0x7000 - 0x7FFF
# range.

# The sending daemon received a message it doesn't know how to handle,
# forward it to the correct daemon.
