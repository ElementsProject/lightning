/**
 * check_type - routines for compile time type checking
 *
 * C has fairly weak typing: ints get automatically converted to longs, signed
 * to unsigned, etc.  There are some cases where this is best avoided, and
 * these macros provide methods for evoking warnings (or build errors) when
 * a precise type isn't used.
 *
 * On compilers which don't support typeof() these routines are less effective,
 * since they have to use sizeof() which can only distiguish between types of
 * different size.
