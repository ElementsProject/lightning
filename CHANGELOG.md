# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Documentation: Added CHANGELOG.md
- JSON API: `getinfo` has new fields `alias` and `color`.
- JSON API: `listpeers` has new fields `global_features` and `local_features`.
- JSON API:`listnodes` has new field `global_features`.
- Protocol: gossipd now deliberately delays spamming with `channel_update`.
- Config: `--conf` option to set config file.

### Changed

- Config: You can only announce one address if each type (IPv4, IPv6,
  TORv2, TORv3).
- Protocol: Fee estimates are now smoothed over time, to avoid sudden jumps.
- lightning-cli: the help command for a specific command now runs the
  `man` command.
- HSM: The HSM daemon now maintains the per-peer secrets, rather than
  handing them out.  It's still lax in what it signs though.
- connectd: A new daemon `lightningd_connectd` handles connecting
  to/from peers, instead of `gossipd` doing that itself.
- Test: `python-xdist` is now a dependency for tests.
- Logging: JSON connections no longer spam debug logs.

### Deprecated

Note: You should always set `allow-deprecated-apis=false` to test for
changes.

### Removed

- JSON API: `listpeers` results no long have `alias` and `color` fields;
  they're in `listnodes` (we used to internally merge the information).
- Removed all Deprecated options from 0.6.

### Fixed

- Options: `bind-addr` of a publicly accessible network address was announced.
- Protocol: `node_announcement` multiple addresses are correctly ordered and uniquified.
- JSON API: `listnodes`: now displays node aliases and colors even if they
  don't advertise a network address
- JSON API: `fundchannel all`: now restricts to 2^24-1 satoshis rather than failing.
- When we reconnect and have to retransmit failing HTLCs, the errors weren't
  encrypted by us.
- `lightningd_config` man page is now installed by `make install`.
- Fixed crash when shutting down during opening a channel (#1737)
- Don't lose track of our own output when applying penalty transaction (#1738)
- Protocol: `channel_update` inside error messages now refers to correct channel.

### Security

## [0.6] - 2018-06-22
